<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Spotty will live! Veterinarians at
the Jordan University for Science and Technology (JUST) in Irbid were able to
remove bones found in his intestines.&nbsp; These bones, which were obstructing
parts of his intestines, were making Spotty refuse food for more than 4
days.&nbsp; In a phone call with The Zureikat Weekly, Reema said, &quot;The
president of the university was involved.&nbsp; The team was a wonderful
team.&nbsp; Spotty is now under my care!&nbsp; He is on medication and
fluids.&nbsp; He'll start on baby food on Friday (Feb. 23), no bones at
all.&nbsp; It will take some time for him to recover.&quot;&nbsp; In the phone
call, Reema also said, &quot;It was quite an experience.&nbsp; I have been
forced into this.&nbsp; The year 2001 started with two new experiences, New York
and Spotty.&quot;&nbsp; Reema concluded the phone call by saying, &quot;HABIB
HABIBI HABIBI!&quot;</font></p>
