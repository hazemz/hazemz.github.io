an exclusive phone call with The Zureikat Weekly, Bashar said, &quot;It all
started two months ago when they called me at home.&nbsp; They had taken my name
from the university because I was one of the top of my class, and they called me
for a test.&nbsp; 150 applicants came for the test.&nbsp; After seeing the
results of the test, we were short listed to 50 people, and, after that, we went
to a series interviews (6 in Bashar's case), the last which was with Suheir
Al-Ali, President of the bank, on Thursday, April 5.&nbsp; And after that last
interview in 2 hours, they called me and offered me a position.&quot;&nbsp;
Bashar, who completed all the requirements for his BA degree last January,
signed his contract with Citibank on Thursday, April 5, and will start his new
job on Sunday, April 8, 2001.&nbsp; The Zureikat Weekly would like to take this
