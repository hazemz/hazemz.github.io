<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Harran is up and around and almost
ready to go back to work after undergoing a partial thyroidectomy in the Jordan
Hospital on Thursday, February 15.&nbsp; In a statement made to The Zureikat
Weekly, Harran said that due to the presence of a lump in the thyroid gland,
doctors had to extract the right lope of it (the thyroid gland).&nbsp; In a
similar statement, Reema said, &quot;The biopsy showed negative; everything is
ok.&nbsp; His recovery was very speedy, and, after two hours of his operation,
he was eating solid food, and he was attending to his patients as they called
him in the room!&quot;&nbsp; Harran returned home on Friday, February 16, 2001,
one day after his operation.&nbsp; Sources say he may return to work on Sunday.</font></p>
