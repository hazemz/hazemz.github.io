Dana, and Hazem attended an Awards Banquet held by Tarek to recognize the
Jordanian students, including Bashar, who had worked with him during the summer
for the Southwestern Company in the US. As the student manager and organization
leader, Tarek spoke at the beginning of the banquet about the experience he and
his team gained during the summer. During the banquet, each student gave a red
rose to his mother as a symbol of his love and appreciation, and Tarek later
gave the students their awards. Bashar, who thanked Tarek for his efforts during
the summer, received the Persistence Award. The banquet was attended by about 25
people. Tarek will be starting his forth summer with the Southwestern Company
next June with even a larger organization.</font></p>
