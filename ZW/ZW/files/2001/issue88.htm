next to leave Amman is Alia on Tuesday, January 9, 2001, accompanied by Edella,
who will be leaving Amman for good. Concerning Edella's departure, Reema told
The Zureikat Weekly in a phone call last week that Edella will be leaving after
20 years of housekeeping at their house. She said that Edella has been a
&quot;fantastic member of the family and a loving and dedicated one&quot;.
&quot;I dread the life without Edella housekeeping,&quot; Reema added, &quot;I
have been warning that they (the family) better eat well before her departure,
because I believe that the whole family will turn to vegetarians, and they will
live on fast food eventually.&quot; Harran made a toast to Edella in front of
the whole family on Christmas Eve two weeks ago.</font></p>
