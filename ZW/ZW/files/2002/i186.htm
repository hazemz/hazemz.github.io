Hala said, &quot;In a telephone call this morning, Dian explained to me that she has 
an<br>
infection in the nerves in her hand and shoulder.&nbsp; She was very busy having 
carpenters at home doing maintenance, so she is very tired.&nbsp; Hassan is 
sick.&nbsp; He has grippe but fine.&nbsp; Dian will do blood tests for Youbi to 
check whether he has to remove his tonsils or not.&quot;&nbsp; As for the health 
situation in her family, Hala said, &quot;We had a nice Christmas party with the 
Zarzar family, our friends, Thursday afternoon.&nbsp; It was cold, and the 
party was by the pool.&nbsp; Nice food, nice carols, but it was freezing.&nbsp; 
Going home that night, all my kids were sick, vomiting and high fever 39.5.&nbsp; 
It started with Salem at 10:00 pm on Thursday; Friday, early morning, Deena, and 
then, in the afternoon, Dalia.&nbsp; Right away, Naief started 
investigations...Could it be the Zarzar?&nbsp; But finally, he came to the 
conclusion that it may be the sandwiches he did for the kids on Thursday 
morning.&nbsp; It was Hommos.&nbsp; Only they and our maid ate from them, and 
she also is sick, so, the problem is Naief, hahahaha.&nbsp; He was feeling very 
guilty, but still we don't know the reason exactly.&quot;</font></p>

is due to the camera and not the photographer.&nbsp; Although it's the 
photographer who makes the pictures, it doesn't seem to be so in this case.&nbsp;

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">Amer and I have made a joint venture of purchasing all the 
Grendizer series.&nbsp; In fact, we are the only ones in Jordan who have the 
full 19 original video set.&nbsp; It was our agreement that the videos, although 
owned by both of us, must be safely kept in Amer's room in the event of both of 
us leaving the country.&nbsp; Now that I am back and Amer appears to be moving 
to the US, this issue is not so simple, in fact, could cause serious problems 
since neither of us are prepared to let go of this phenomenal series, and 
splitting them up is not an option.&nbsp; I have not discussed this with Amer 
yet, however, this subject has caused me a considerable amount of stress lately.&nbsp; 
I have trouble sleeping at night, especially after I found out that Amer has 
changed his phone ring to the Grendizer tune.&nbsp; I wonder if he was signaling 
something to me with that.&nbsp; Today, however, my case received a boost from 
Leanne, who, when I brought up the subject, said, and I quote, &quot;You keep them 
for God's sake.&nbsp; Khallisni minhom (the videos)&quot;.&nbsp; I have made this 
story public not to cause problems, but, hopefully, to avoid them.&nbsp; When 
Amer comes back, hopefully, the Zureikats will persuade him that the videos 
should be left with me when he leaves to the US.&quot;</font></i></p>
