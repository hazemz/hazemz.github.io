<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Hazem graduated from Amman National School on 
Thursday, July 11, 2002.&nbsp; The graduation ceremony, which was held at the 
school, was attended by many Zureikats.&nbsp; During the ceremony, Marwan 
delivered the parents' speech.&nbsp; Hazem is the fourth Zureikat to graduate 
from Amman National School, after Bashar, Tarek, and Omar.&nbsp; This year, 
Hazem was the only one among the 38 graduates to graduate with distinction.&nbsp; 
What should also be mentioned is that Abla Z. was this year's host at the 
graduation.&nbsp; Abla last hosted ANS's graduation ceremony in 1996, the year 
Tarek graduated.&nbsp; After the graduation ceremony, Marwan, Abla N., Hazem, 
and Abla Z. attended the graduation dinner which was held at the Bristol Hotel 
in Amman.&nbsp; <b>(Please note that digital pictures were not taken at the 
ceremony.&nbsp; We will probably be scanning the normal pictures as soon as they 
are available.)</b></font></p>

The 4th of July was a wonderful day, and I would like to thank each and every
