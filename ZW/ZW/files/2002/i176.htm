home on Monday, October 7, made a surprising return on Thursday, October 3, 
2002.&nbsp; After studying and working in the UK and the US for the past six 
years, Tarek will now be working in Jordan.&nbsp; In a chat session with the 
Editor in Chief, Tarek said, &quot;I would like to thank the Zureikats for the warm 
welcome I received and promise the Karadshehs and Hassan that I will be visiting 
them soon.&nbsp; It's good to be back home after a rocky year.&quot;&nbsp; When asked 
about his future plans, Tarek said, &quot;For the next four months, I will be 
undergoing an orientation period where I will be learning about my father's 
business of which I know nothing about, and then I will see where I can add 
value.&nbsp; In the long run, I can see myself being involved with JCE, and, 
maybe, if the opportunity allows me, running my own business, in a 
sales-oriented industry.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">I noted with interest your 
decision to appoint Abla N. as a photographer for the Weekly.&nbsp; I know that 
you were impressed with the contribution that she had made to the Weekly's 
pictures library, particularly in the last two issues, but ignored to consider 
the number of pictures that were wasted in the process.&nbsp; Nearly 90% of the 
pictures that she has taken were either (not there) or were so bad that one 
would wish they were (not there).&nbsp; Furthermore, your decision will 
jeopardize our continued effort to train her on how to use the mobile phone that 
she had been carrying for over two years since she will now be devoting more 
time to (PHOTOGRAPHY).</font></i></p>
