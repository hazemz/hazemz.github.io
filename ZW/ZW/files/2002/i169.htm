August 10.&nbsp; In a phone call with the Editor in Chief after his return, 
Hassan said, &quot;I had a meeting in Street No. 7 in Maadi, so I took a driver at 9 
am, and we reached the street at 6 pm.&nbsp; They were closing.&nbsp; 
Apparently, the real name of the street is Street No. 107, but many call it 
Street No. 7.&nbsp; The conclusion of all this is: If you want to run a business 
in Egypt, you have to be sure that nothing comes on time in Egypt, except one 
thing, when a woman gets pregnant, in 9 months she'll deliver!&quot;&nbsp; Hassan had 
left to Cairo on Tuesday, August 6, 2002, on a four-day business trip.</font></p>
