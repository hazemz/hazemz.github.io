Appointing Abla as Photographer Continues to Evolve as Marwan Replies to Ziad 
and Leanne's E-mails</font></p>

<p align="center" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">
<img border="0" src="marwan.jpg" width="178" height="137"></font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Marwan sent the following e-mail to 
the Editor in Chief in response to what Ziad and Leanne lately wrote regarding 
the issue of appointing Abla N. as a ZW Photographer:</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">The Editor in Chief,<br>
The Zureikat Weekly,<br>
Minnesota,<br>
USA</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">Dear Sir,</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">I have read the recent comments 
made by Ziad and Leanne on my letter to the Editor concerning the appointment of 
Abla N. as a Weekly Photographer.&nbsp; I do not doubt their good intentions, 
but one must not exclude their “ulterior motives”.&nbsp; Abla, as you know, is 
Ziad's patient.&nbsp; He also made no secret of the fact that he enjoys her 
cooking.&nbsp; Leanne's position, on the other hand, is completely understood 
being a new member of The Zureikat Weekly.</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">I believe that the recent 
technological advancement in telecommunication will contribute to ending the 
argument over this issue.&nbsp; I am referring, of course, to the combined 
cellular-camera system referred to as VP (Videophone).&nbsp; I will shortly 
arrange for Abla to have one of those as soon as we sort out some minor 
outstanding issues.&nbsp; One of such issues was indirectly alluded to in Ziad's 
letter when he used the word &quot;passion&quot; to describe Abla N.'s pictures.&nbsp; 
Both Ziad and Leanne, as well as many others, do not know that Abla exhibit the 
same passion when using her mobile phone.&nbsp; This is most seen when Abla N. 
discovers, when trying to use her phone, that there are “missed call(s)”.&nbsp; 
For reasons that are not apparent to us, Abla N.'s reaction would be to shout 
out loudly &quot;EH EH MISSSSSSED CAOOOAL.&quot;&nbsp; The surprise, agony, or &quot;passion&quot; 
(to use Ziad's words) continue while she is searching for her eyeglasses to 
proceed then into a process of finding the right button to solve the mystery 
(using trial and error techniques, of course).&nbsp; The whole ordeal ends by 
the last sigh of relief together with the name of the missed caller.&nbsp; I 
referred to this as one of the issues to be resolved as I do not know how the 
new VP show the missed calls and whether or not it shows pictures rather than 
words, etc, and how will Abla N.'s reaction be like.</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">I am grateful to The Zureikat 
Weekly for giving me the chance to share my ideas on this issue with the family 
members.</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">Please accept my kind regards,<br>
Marwan Zureikat</font></i></p>
