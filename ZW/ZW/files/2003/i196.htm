<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">Ammar sent the following e-mail to The Zureikat Weekly:</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">Dear Zureikat Family:</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">It is my honor and great pleasure to become a member of 
The Zureikat Weekly that I have heard so much about from Dana during the course 
of our relationship.&nbsp; She obviously views this electronic journal as a 
source of pride for the Zureikats and a major accomplishment by its Editor in 
Chief, her brother, Hazem.</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">For those of you who don’t know the story, I had met Dana 
on November 8th, shortly after her arrival to Washington DC, at a restaurant 
called “Café Milano” and truly felt, especially after getting to know her, that 
I had met the woman of my dreams and my other half.&nbsp; We have spent a 
considerable amount of quality time together since then and have grown to care 
and love each other tremendously.&nbsp; Most importantly, Dana and I have also 
become best friends.</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">February 20th was a very special day for Dana and me.&nbsp; 
We wished we were in Amman to celebrate the engagement (Tulba) with our 
families.&nbsp; I would like to thank everyone who attended.</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">Special thanks to Amu Marwan, Auntie Abla, Tarek, Hazem, 
and, of course, Abu Harran, who gave a memorable speech at the event and made 
this special day “perfect”. </font></i></p>

this opportunity to congratulate Amal on her new post and wish her all the best.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><b><font face="Arial">Following is an editorial which 
was published in Thursday's edition of the Jordan Times:</font></b></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial"><b><font size="4">Advancing the 
human rights cause </font></b></font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">THE FORMATION of the Board of 
Trustees of the National Centre for Human Rights (NCHR) was the fruit of many 
years of painstaking work and preparation. The support of Their Majesties King 
Abdullah and Queen Rania for the creation of a national human rights body gave a 
fresh and determined impetus to the over a decade-long call for such an 
institution and the creation of the post of a human rights ombudsman. That the 
21-member board of trustees is headed by former Prime Minister Ahmed Obeidat is 
encouraging. Obeidat comes with credentials as a strong and determined supporter 
of the cause of human rights in Jordan recognised both locally and 
internationally. </font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Now it is up to the newly formed 
board to make something meaningful of the NCHR by the articulation and adoption 
of viable and operational policies to advance the cause of human rights in the 
country. The first order of business, it would seem, is to make sure that 
Jordanian practices and policies are in conformity with the country's 
legislation. Secondly, to embark on an investigative course to determine where 
national laws are or are not in conformity with international norms and 
standards that are binding on the country. This course would require giving our 
human rights treaty obligations the force of law, something that has yet to be 
done. </font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The promotion and protection of 
economic, social and cultural rights must be pursued in parallel with the 
promotion and protection of civil and political rights. The King has repeatedly 
alluded to this issue by calling on the government to give equal attention to 
both sets of rights. It has been proven worldwide that the pursuit of one set of 
rights cannot be done in isolation of the other. The creation of the post of 
ombudsman would, likewise, be a most welcome development as such an office would 
serve as the pivotal point for streamlining the national efforts to promote and 
protect human rights across the board in the Kingdom. </font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The fact that the NCHR will 
enjoy a great degree of independence and has a broad-based mandate should give 
it ample opportunity to carry out its functions under the most favourable 
conditions. In the final analysis it is up to the newly formed board of trustees 
to make a success of NCHR. If the board takes seriously enough its mandate and 
goes about its work in earnest, there is no reason for it to fail. The country 
needs a NCHR that is operational and serious. It is up to the centre to prove 
its worth to the people of Jordan.</font></p>

<b><font face="Arial" size="5">The American Public is being lied to everyday</font></b></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">by Tarek Zuriekat <br>
<br>
The most recent polls according to Fox news suggest that 69% of the American 
population are supporting a military attack on Iraq, while 23% oppose it, making 
the US the only country in the world (along with Israel I suppose) whose 
population support the war. After watching CNN and other American news channels, 
I was surprised by the 23% who are opposed to war. I suppose those are the ones 
that read European newspapers. Americans are told a different truth about what 
is happening by their politicians and their media.<br>
<br>
Yesterday witnessed the biggest peace demonstration in the world. Polls in 
Britain and Spain (the only supporters of war in the UN assembly) suggest that 
over 70% of their population is against the war. With a UN backing, the support 
in Spain for war would rise to only 28%. In Turkey (a likely US base and a 
traditional ally), the polls show that 90% are against the war. Those are the 
people the US hopes are most sympathetic to its plans. It is therefore clear 
that the majority of the world is against war at this time. Nevertheless, 
yesterday, Fox News broadcasted an interview with Senator Bob McCain talking 
about the &quot;increased isolation&quot; of France and Germany in their stance against 
the war. This &quot;isolation&quot; has been reiterated endlessly on CNN. That is what the 
Americans are being told.<br>
<br>
Another issue regularly raised is the prospect of Iraq being the &quot;first 
democracy&quot; in the region. No explanation is required. It is a given fact. I will 
not go into the historic argument of how America has, on many occasions, done 
the complete opposite by placing a military dictator in place of a 
democratically elected leader as in the case of Chili and Indonesia. I will only 
point out the following: Lebanon is a full-fledged democracy, with a 
democratically elected leader, democratically elected PM, and a freedom of 
speech that is envied by the majority of the Arab world. It is no coincidence 
that all the &quot;experts&quot; on CNN, and indeed the people interviewing them, failed 
to spot this. Iran also has a democratically elected leader, President Khatami. 
The Republics of Iran and Lebanon have something else in common. They are both 
likely targets for US assault should the strike on Iraq be successful. The media 
campaign there against both these countries in the US has already begun.<br>
<br>
Another point worth mentioning is that none of the &quot;experts&quot; who were discussing 
the likelihood of an &quot;Iraqi democracy&quot; after the war talked about the prospect 
of having a Shi’ite leader elected to rule Iraq. This is an outcome the US would 
never allow because a Shi’ite leader would likely be an ally to Iran. Why should 
there be one? Maybe because the majority of the Iraqi population are Shi’ites, a 
fact that has surprisingly eluded the &quot;experts&quot; on CNN.<br>
<br>
To be fair though, the worldwide protests received a lot of coverage in the US 
media. The problem was the incorporation of the word &quot;anti-Americanism&quot; 
throughout the coverage. It is anti-American for European politicians to be 
against the war, but its not anti-European for Rumsfeld to publicly insult 
France and Germany, in such a blunt manner that would have made Reagan blush. It 
is anti-Americanism for Belgium, Germany, and France to block NATO from arming 
Turkey against the prospect of an Iraqi retaliation (a much weaker country 
militarily), but it is not anti-Arabism for the US to veto a UN resolution to 
send peacekeeping forces to the occupied territory of the West Bank to defend an 
unarmed occupied population against the fourth most powerful army in the world, 
the Israeli army. But then again Israel is in &quot;self-defence&quot; and if you question 
that you’re &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;.</font></p>
