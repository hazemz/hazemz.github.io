<font face="Arial">Zureikats gathered at Marwan and Abla's on Sunday, August 17, 
to watch the final episode of the first season of Superstar on Future 
Television.&nbsp; Results of the voting, which were announced the next day, 
showed that Diana Carazon, a Jordanian, had received 52 percent of the 4.8 
million votes which were cast from all around the Arab World using the internet 
and mobile phones, making Carazon the first Superstar of the Arab World.&nbsp; 
Following is the front-page article which was published in the Jordan Times on 
Tuesday, August 19, 2003, a day after the results were announced:</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial"><font size="5">Diana Carazon is a Superstar!</font><br>
<b><i>By Natasha Twal</i></b></font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">AMMAN — Jordanian singer Diana Carazon was made victorious 
Monday night, beating out thousands of competitors in a pan-Arab vocal 
competition to be crowned “Superstar” on Future TV's programme of the same name.
</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">The victory, announced last night after two days of intensive 
polling, brought forth nationwide jubilation, with many citizens taking to the 
streets hoisting Jordanian flags and carrying pictures of the Jordanian singer. 
Gunshots and car horns honking filled the hot summer night in the Jordanian 
capital. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">Carazon's acquisition of 52 percent of 4.8 million audience 
votes won her a one-year record contract and extensive publicity, leaving rival 
Syrian singer Rowaida Attieh first runner-up. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">Carazon told The Jordan Times in an exclusive interview 
Sunday that “regardless of the final results I am ecstatic.” The singer has 
already secured a contract with Warner Arabia's Music Master. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">She also said she was overwhelmed by the support from the 
Arab world — principally Jordan, as the Kingdom has shown remarkable support 
through newspaper ads and banners, as well as television and radio announcements 
and programmes. Carazon was also given an Opel automobile, as a gift from a car 
dealership due to her “most beautiful voice.” </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">A number of mammoth screens were erected in various places 
throughout the capital showing the final performances for the show, as well as 
her final victory. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">For computer engineering student Wajeeh Saeed, voting for a 
fellow Jordanian was about national pride. “It will be great if Jordan can 
present a superstar to the world since Jordanian stars have been away from 
Arabic pop singing scene for a long time,” Saeed told The Jordan Times. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">“I voted for her 146 times via the Internet,” said Saeed, as 
he sat in an ice cream shop, which promised free product to those that voted for 
Carazon. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">“She has a very nice voice and she's Jordanian too,” said 
student Hakam Abdul Karim, 25. Karim said he also backed Carazon out of sympathy 
because of contestant Melhem Zein's comment to vote for Attieh after he was 
ejected. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">“All the people, they care about this show more than anything 
else,” he added. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">“I think she deserves it,” said 20-year-old student Sara 
Baradakji, while eating lunch with friends Monday. Baradakji says even though 
her family comes from Syria, she is Jordanian and supports Carazon. “She's 
beautiful [and] has nice charisma.” </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">It was also discovered that there was another Jordanian 
winner, as the $25,000 prize drawn from all the mobile numbers that voted 
throughout the programme was revealed to be a Jordanian telephone number. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">In a related development, the Islamic Action Front (IAF) 
called on official authorities Monday to end the “outrageous and exaggerated 
publicity that has surrounded Superstar.” </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">In a statement, the IAF warned that the programme “distracted 
citizens from national issues” and was a corruption of the public taste, harming 
social values. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">The programme “toys with people's feelings, consciousness and 
awareness,” read the statement, facilitating the process of cultural imperialism 
led by the US in an attempt to change people's cultural identity. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">Airing on Lebanon's Future TV satellite channel, the 
21-episode “Superstar” was licensed from Fremantle Media and 19TV ad is the 
Arabic version of the UK programme “Pop Idol,” which sprang to life in 2001.</font></p>
