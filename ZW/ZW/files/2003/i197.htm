<b><font face="Arial" size="5">The snow storm started on Monday and ended on 
Thursday</font></b></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">A severe snow storm, possibly the strongest in about ten 
years, hit Jordan between Monday and Thursday, February 24 and 27, 2003.&nbsp; 
The storm resulted in the closure of all schools, universities, and offices for 
three days, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.&nbsp; Most roads in Amman were 
also closed from Monday evening and all through Tuesday and Wednesday.&nbsp; Following are the 
'damage reports' from our Correspondents and Photographer:</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial" size="5">Alia:</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">&quot;The Harran household survived the snow pretty well, as the 
damages were 'materialistic', using Reema's words.&nbsp; A number of trees died, 
the pool solar system broke down, and the garage door collapsed! (thankfully, 
the cars were far apart from one another!), and, Friday evening, we had water 
flooding from the storeroom.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial" size="5">Abla N.:</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">In a phone call with the Editor in Chief, Abla said that the 
melting snow resulted in a leakage in the living room and in other parts of the 
house.&nbsp; The main door was also damaged.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial" size="5">Amal:</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">&quot;We had leaking in the reception area in two places, so we, 
Ziad and I, started to clean the terraces in the master bed room and the family 
room.&nbsp; Two hours of hard work since we don't have a maid or a gardener.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial" size="5">Bana:</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">&quot;At first, when it started snowing, all the family was 
excited, as it meant that there would be no school/work for the next few days.&nbsp; 
However, by the time the third day of being stuck at home had passed, everyone 
was in a cranky mood, and everyone was arguing with everyone.&nbsp; So much for 
spending quality time with the family!!</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">As for the damage report, we woke up to the sound of a crash 
on Tuesday morning.&nbsp; Apparently,&nbsp; the snow that had fallen upon our 
Jasmine tree was so heavy, it caused the tree to break and fall, pulling down 
with it the iron bars that protect our window (that was the sound of the crash).&nbsp; 
Other damages included (as expected) broken trees and plants in the orchard.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial" size="6">Harran and Reema Adventure to Anjara!</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">After mentioning her damage report in her weekly e-mail to 
the Editor in Chief, Alia said, &quot;We also had a bit of adventure!&nbsp; Knowing 
Harran, he would not allow something like snow to get in the way of going to 
Anjara.&nbsp; Poor Reema had to obediently follow.&nbsp; Apparently, once they 
got to the Ajloun area, 'gharrazoo'!&nbsp; Reema even went as far as to describe 
the event as &quot;shoft il mout bi 3einey!&quot;&nbsp; To conclude, I can definitely say 
that the one person in the family who was celebrating was Harran.&nbsp; To use 
Abla Z.'s words, &quot;Al-Tifel Al-Mundahesh&quot; - the elated child - was definitely 
having a blast!!</font></p>

February 27, 2003.&nbsp; However, a number of Zureikats made it to work on that 
day.&nbsp; Others resumed their jobs on Saturday and Sunday, March 1 and 2.&nbsp; 
Zureikat students also returned to their schools and universities on Sunday, 
March 2, 2003.</font></p>

<font face="Arial">The Jordanian Consulting Engineer Company, with Marwan as the 
chairman of its board, was awarded the 2002 'Ministry of Public Works' Award for 
a distinguished project.&nbsp; In an e-mail he sent to the Editor in Chief, Marwan said, &quot;The Award will be given shortly in a formal reception organized by 
the Ministry and the Association of Engineers.&nbsp; The project selected was 
the Lajjoun Water Supply Project.&nbsp; This is a major water supply project 
valued at nearly US$40 million.&nbsp; JCE managed to complete the designs and 
carry out the supervision of the project which was completed in a record 9 
months.&quot;&nbsp; What should be mentioned is that the 'Ministry of Public Works' 
Award had started in 2001 and is given to one consulting company every year.&nbsp; 
The Zureikat Weekly would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Marwan 
and the JCE family on this distinguished award and wish them all the best.</font></p>
