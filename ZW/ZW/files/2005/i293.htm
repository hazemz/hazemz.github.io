wanted to wish everyone a very happy Christmas and a lovely new year.&nbsp; It's 
my first Christmas abroad, and I've missed many of our little traditions that 
makes Christmas what it is for us: Christmas eve with Reema's chicken pie 
specialty, Tarek's yeeha game (although I'm definitely better than him) and 
Abla's ability to make everyone sing.&nbsp; I've been working nights during 
Christmas, but some of my friends included me in their Christmas tradition, 
which was lovely.&nbsp; I even got to go carol singing in a village in Hampshire 
which was a beautiful experience.&nbsp; I have a few days off for new year's, 
and I have spent those in Megeve in France, skiing...my regards to everybody.&nbsp; 
Love, Reem.&quot;</font></p>
