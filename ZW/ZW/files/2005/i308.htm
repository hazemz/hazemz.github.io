<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Next week, Zureikats around the 
world will be reading the final issue of a weekly family newsletter that has 
managed to continue for six years, bringing family news and pictures to 
its readers wherever they were.&nbsp; The Zureikat Weekly started with a short, 
picture-less issue on Friday, April 23, 1999, and underwent major changes and 
overhauls throughout the past years, the most important of which was in 
September 2002, when the Editor in Chief moved to the US.&nbsp; The move allowed 
for increased contributions from other family members, as correspondents and 
photographers were appointed to join the effort of maintaining the newsletter.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Changing times and priorities, 
however, have caused the Editor in Chief to announce the discontinuation of this 
newsletter after the 309th issue is released on April 24, 2005.&nbsp; The move 
drew wide criticism from several members of the family, including 
correspondents.&nbsp; The move also initiated an effort by other members of the 
family to start another weekly newsletter, which would be sent by e-mail every 
week starting May 1.</font></p>

	Wednesday said they were committed to their stand against the formation and 
	composition of the new government.&nbsp; During a meeting, they also 
	entrusted Lower House Speaker Abdul Hadi Majali to be a liaison between them 
	and government or any other party.&nbsp; Deputy Abdel Jalil Maatyeh (Karak) 
	told reporters after the meeting that the lawmakers called for their demands 
	to be met. Maatyeh, however, said the MPs also realise that the government 
	should take sufficient time to do so.&nbsp; Prime Minister Adnan Badran 
	recently said that when the government was formed, the focus was on the 
	qualifications of the team entrusted with reform.&nbsp; Thirty-four deputies 
	issued a statement on Sunday criticising the formation of the new Cabinet 
	and Badran for not consulting the Lower House on its formation.&nbsp; The 
	statement also expressed the signatories' dissatisfaction with the 
	composition, saying it did not “fairly represent all regions,” which 
	contradicts Royal directives to relegate more authority to the regions of 
	the Kingdom. The number of signatories increased to 41 on Wednesday. </font>
