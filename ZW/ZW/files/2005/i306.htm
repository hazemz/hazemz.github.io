Zureikats Urge Editor in Chief to Reconsider</font></b></p>
<p align="center" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 18pt">Yacoub 
volunteers to continue releasing ZW</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">A number of family members sent 
e-mails to the Editor in Chief last week asking him to reconsider the decision 
to discontinue The Zureikat Weekly on April 24.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Yacoub S. 
volunteered to continue releasing the ZW, as an e-mail newsletter, after April 
24.&nbsp; The Editor in Chief would like to take this opportunity to say the 
following:</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">I think I speak for all of us 
when I say that Yacoub's initiative to continue releasing the ZW is very much 
appreciated.&nbsp; However, I would like to make one comment: My decision to 
discontinue the Weekly did not come because I just don't feel like releasing the 
newsletter anymore but, rather (as I mentioned in the previous issue), because I 
believe the family no longer needs a newsletter.&nbsp; Again, I appreciate 
Yacoub's offer, and I leave it to him and to the rest of the family to decide on 
any future plans.</font></i></p>
