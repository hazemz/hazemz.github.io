	businessman who helped rebuild his country after decades of war but resigned 
	last fall amid a sharp dispute with Syria.&nbsp; At least 12 other people 
	were killed and 100 wounded, including a former economy minister. The blast 
	raised immediate fears that Lebanon — largely peaceful since the 1990 end of 
	its civil war — was headed towards a new and bloody twist in its divisive 
	dispute over the role of Syria, which maintains about 15,000 troops in the 
	country.&nbsp; A statement issued by the American University Hospital said 
	Hariri was pronounced dead on arrival, his body mutilated.&nbsp; Some 350 
	kilograms of TNT explosives were used in the bombing, security officials 
	said on condition of anonymity. They did not say whether the explosives were 
	placed in a vehicle or on the side of the street.&nbsp; A few days after the 
	assassination, Lebanon's opposition called for a peaceful &quot;independence
