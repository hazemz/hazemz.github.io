		<p><i><font face="Arial" color="#800000">As the Zureikat Web enters its 
		fourth successful month, I have made a decision not to appoint any 
		correspondents. The current system -- in which I send an e-mail to all 
		family members every now and then asking for their news -- seems to be 
		working fine. It also encourages everyone to participate in the 
		reporting of family news.</font></i></p>
		<p><i><font face="Arial" color="#800000">However, since I will need some 
		help in managing this website, I have decided to appoint Alia as 
		Assistant to the Managing Editor.</font></i></p>
		<p><i><font face="Arial" color="#800000">Thank you all for your 
		contributions. Keep it up.</font></i></p>
		<p><i><font face="Arial" color="#800000">NOTE: I would also like to 
		reiterate the fact that this is a 'blog-style' website. News here are 
		reported in chronological order, not in any order of 'importance'. News
