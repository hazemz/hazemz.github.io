		</b>By Francesca Sawalha</i></font></p>
		<p><img border="0" src="p0043001.jpg" width="263" height="360"><font face="Arial" color="#800000"><i> </i></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">Amal Yacoub Zureikat Sharayha is 
		radiant. She smiles with her eyes, in addition to her mouth. &quot;Everyone 
		should have a beautiful smile,&quot; she says. &quot;Every child has the right to 
		a beautiful smile.&quot; </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">Giving people a beautiful smile is 
		Dr Sharayha's job. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">The first Jordanian woman 
		periodontist - actually the first woman east of New York to ever attain 
		a diploma by the American Board of Periodontists - has not limited 
		herself to becoming a successful dentist, with a well-established, 
		state-of-the art, spotless and chic clinic in Shmeisani. As a board 
		member of the Higher Dental Education Council, she's actively involved 
		in efforts to raise professional standards. She also dedicates a great 
		deal of time and energy to helping others. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">Her work as chairperson of 
		Operation Smile-Jordan is what makes her most proud. &quot;We carried out our 
		first mission last year, we helped more than 700 Jordanian children, 
		especially in the south. It was a dream come true.&quot; With Operation 
		Smile, Sharayha is now trying to work on a study on the incidence of 
		cleft lip and cleft palate in the Kingdom, and establish a specialised 
		centre that would serve the entire region. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">But her involvement for the 
		betterment of her community does not end there. She is also a member of 
		the board of trustees of the National Centre for Human Rights and a 
		member of the Jordan Chapter of the International Women's Forum. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">But it is still dentistry That has 
		always been Sharayha's passion. &quot;I love dentistry, I love my job.&quot;
		</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">Nowadays, the Jordan Dental 
		Association counts some 3,600 members, 1,600 of whom are women. But 
		things were different back in 1972, when, as a young graduate, Dr 
		Sharayha started practising in the army. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">&quot;It was tough. This is a 
		male-dominated society, and dentistry in general was still considered a 
		man's profession.&quot; </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">But she carried on tenaciously and 
		left for the US to obtain her specialisation from the University of 
		Texas in 1982. By that time, she already had two toddlers, and was 
		expecting twins. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">If it is true that, as the old 
		saying goes, behind every great man, there is a great woman, then it is 
		also true that behind a great woman there is often a greatly supportive 
		man. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">&quot;I wouldn't have reached where I 
		am today without my husband. In order to complete my specialisation, I 
		had to leave our two children behind with him and take off to Texas, and 
		study hard, while pregnant with twins.&quot; </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">After her specialisation, Dr 
		Sharayha took a vow she'd keep until her children grew up: Never to work 
		in the afternoons. Her eldest daughter is now a doctor, studying for her 
		own specialisation. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">&quot;My job is about making people 
		beautiful and making them feel good. If you are not going to read and 
		subscribe to the best journals, if you are not going to update yourself 
		and undergo regular training, if you are not going to keep up with the 
		latest in the field, then you should not even think about going into 
		dentistry.&quot;</font></p>
