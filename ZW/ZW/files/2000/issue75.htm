<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial" size="6">E-mails from

<img border="0" src="talal.jpg" width="178" height="137"></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Sylvia sent an
e-mail to the Editor in Chief last week.&nbsp; In her e-mail, Sylvia said,
&quot;I know I'm a bad writer, but I want you to know that you are doing a
wonderful job with these news from the Zureikat family (somehow you keep the
bounds of our family together like Gidde always did).&nbsp; I heard the News
about Giddo and his operation...I know I haven't been in Amman for such a long
time, but I do think of you all a lot and I want to see my Giddo this year so he
and I can talk about the old Arabic poetry, eat Warag Dawaly and drink Araq<br>
together.&nbsp; Give all my love, and when you see Giddo, tell him I think of
him, and he better get well again.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Editor in
Chief also received the following from Alia: &quot;For the past two weeks or so, since I have arrived in the UK, I have been up north in Hemel
Hempstead doing intensive physiotherapy.&nbsp; It was ok, but tough!&nbsp; After the sessions were over, we, my mother and I, came here to Surrey to unload my things at university and then go to my uncle,
Samir's, house.&nbsp; Dana even came over for a traditional Sunday lunch!!&nbsp;
It was sort of like a family reunion, as Amer, who was on his way back to Dublin, uncle Jack,
who lives in Cardiff, Wales, and his son Faris were also there.&nbsp; Today (Oct
2), I started classes.&nbsp; Everything seems to be going ok.&nbsp; My subjects are the same as the last two
years but a lot harder!&nbsp; So this definitely means more work and no play, at least for the next six months or so.&nbsp;
God help me!!&nbsp; I hope you are all doing fine.&nbsp; Send my love to all for now.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Talal also sent
the following e-mail to The Zureikat Weekly: &quot;Everything here is fine,
although I am pressured a lot, but I am enjoying every moment of it.&nbsp; This
weekend, we are going to the Dolomites in the Alps Mountains.&nbsp; It's gonna
be amazing.&nbsp; I am going there with the climbing group.&nbsp; It will be one
hell of a challenge and a wonderful experience.&quot;</font></p>
