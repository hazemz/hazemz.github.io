<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">After arriving in Milan, Italy last
January, Helene started studying at Bocconi University.&nbsp; In an e-mail to
The Zureikat Weekly, Helene said, &quot;A week ago, I completed my Italian
course here in Italy with a good grade.&nbsp; Now, I have finally started
studying at Bocconi University.&nbsp; I have chosen to take three strategy
courses, one about the fashion industry, another Corporate Finance course, and a
course in Logistics.&nbsp; I especially enjoy studying for the fashion course,
because Milan is the center of fashion in the world, and we will have guest
speakers from Versace, Armani and Gucci at our lectures.&quot;&nbsp; In her
e-mail, Helene also said, &quot;A week ago, I also visited Florence with some
friends from my university.&nbsp; In Florence, we visited the famous Uffizi
museum with artworks from above all Rembrandt, Raphael and da Vinci.&nbsp; The
Duomo (a huge cathedral) was also a<br>
very impressive sight.&nbsp; I will, in the near future, also travel down to
Rome to visit an Italian friend from my university, who is working in Rome at
the moment.&nbsp; As you know, my family and I lived in Rome when I was a child,
so it will be really interesting to see our old &quot;homes&quot; and my old
school again.&quot;</font></p>
