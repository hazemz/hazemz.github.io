<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b><i>Following is an e-mail that
Reema got and wanted to share with the family:</i></B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Chush is a school that caters to
learning-disabled children.&nbsp; Some children remain in Chush for their entire
school career, while others can be mainstreamed into conventional schools.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">At a Chush fund-raising dinner, the
father of a Chush child delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all
who attended.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">After extolling the school and its
dedicated staff, he cried out, &quot;Where is the perfection in my own Shaya?&nbsp;
Everything God does is don with perfections.&nbsp; But my child cannot
understand things as other children do. My child cannot remember facts and
figures as other children do.&nbsp; Where is God's perfection?&quot;&nbsp; The
audience was shocked by the question, pained by the father's anguish and stilled
by the piercing query,&nbsp; &quot;I believe,&quot; the father said, answering
his own question, &quot;that when God brings a child like this into the world,
the perfection he seeks is in the way people react to the child.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">He then told the following story
about his son Shaya:&nbsp; One afternoon Shaya and his father walked past a park
where some boys Shaya knew were playing baseball.&nbsp; Shaya asked, &quot;Do
you think they will let me play?&quot;&nbsp; Shaya's dad knew that his son was
not all that athletic and that most boys would not want him on their team.&nbsp;
But Shaya's father understood that if his son was chosen to play it would give
him a comfortable sense of belonging.&nbsp; The dad approached one of the boys
in the field and asked if Shaya could play.&nbsp; The boy looked around for
guidance from his teammates.&nbsp; Getting non, he took matters into his own
hands and said, &quot;We are losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth
inning.&nbsp; I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him up to bat
in the ninth inning.&quot;&nbsp; Shaya's father was ecstatic as Shaya smiled
broadly.&nbsp; Shaya was told to put on a glove and go out to play short center
field.&nbsp; In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shaya's team scored a few runs
but was still behind by three.&nbsp; In the bottom of the ninth, Shaya's team
scored again and now, with two outs and bases loaded with the potential winning
run on base, Shaya was scheduled to be up.&nbsp; Would the team actually let
Shaya bat at this juncture and give away their chance to win the game? Surprisingly, Shaya was given the bat.&nbsp; Everyone knew that it was all but
impossible because Shaya didn't even know how to hold the bat properly, let
alone hit with it.&nbsp; However as Shaya stepped up to the plate, the pitcher
moved a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shaya swung clumsily and missed.&nbsp;
One of his teammates came up to Shaya and together they held the bat and faced
the pitcher waiting for the next pitch.&nbsp; The pitcher again took a few steps
forward to toss the ball softly toward Shaya.&nbsp; As the pitch came in, Shaya
and his teammate swung at the bat and together they hit a slow ground ball to
the pitcher.&nbsp; The pitcher picked up the grounder and could easily have
thrown the ball to the first baseman.&nbsp; Shaya would have been out and that
would have ended the game.&nbsp; Instead, the pitcher took the ball and threw it
on a high arc to right field, far beyond the first baseman.&nbsp; Everyone
started yelling, &quot;Shaya, run to first!&nbsp; Run to first!&quot; Never in
his life had Shaya run to first.&nbsp; He scampered down the baseline wide-eyed
and startled.&nbsp; By the time he reached first base, the right fielder had the
ball.&nbsp; He could have thrown the ball to the second baseman who would tag
out Shaya, who was still running.&nbsp; But the right fielder understood what
the pitcher's intentions were, so he threw the ball high and far over the third
baseman's head.&nbsp; As Shaya reached second base, the opposing shortstop ran
to him, turned him in the direction of third base, and shouted, &quot;Run to
third.&quot;&nbsp; As Shaya rounded third, the boys from both teams ran behind
him screaming, &quot;Shaya run home!&quot;&nbsp; Shaya ran home, stepped on home
plate and all 18 boys lifted him on their shoulders and made him the hero, as he
had just hit a &quot;grand slam&quot; and won the game for his team.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;That day,&quot; said the
father softly with tears now rolling down his face, &quot;those 18 boys reached
their level of God's perfection&quot;.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Funny how this is so true and shame
on us.&nbsp; Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why
the world is going to hell</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Funny how we believe what the
newspapers say, but question what the Bible says.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Funny how you can send a thousand
jokes through the e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start
sending messaged regarding God, and something good, people think twice about
sharing.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar
and obscene pass freely through cyber space, but the public discussion of God is
suppressed in the school and work place.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Funny isn't it?&nbsp; Funny how when
you go to forward this message, you will not send it to many on your address
list because you're not sure what they believe, or what they will think of you
for sending it to them.</font></p>
