February</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Helene arrived in Milan, Italy,
where she will be studying, ten days ago.&nbsp; In an e-mail to The Zureikat
Weekly, Helene said, &quot;I live in an apartment only five minutes walk to my
university and ten minutes walk to Il Duomo, which is the center of the
city.&nbsp; I am, at the moment, taking an Italian course for three weeks.&nbsp;
My &quot;real&quot; classes will start in mid-February, and most of them will be
in Italian, so it is essential that I learn some Italian before I attend
them!&quot;&nbsp; &quot;People here are really friendly,&quot; Helene continued,
&quot;I found a lot of great new friends, and we do fun things together.&nbsp; I
am considering visiting Talal if he starts mailing me!&quot;&nbsp; Talal is
currently in Trieste, Italy studying in the United World Colleges (UWC).</font></p>

game with the Edinburgh University basketball team...Wednesday&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Tarek, who is currently studying in
Edinburgh, Scotland, visited the Highlands last weekend with the Hillwalking
Society.&nbsp; &quot;We climbed three monros (mountains over 3000 feet),&quot;
he said in an e-mail to The Zureikat Weekly a few days after returning to
Edinburgh from the Highlands, &quot;it was amazing; I had the time of my life
there.&nbsp; At night, we celebrated &quot;Burn's Supper&quot;, which is a
Scottish occasion, the birthday of a Scottish poet called Robert Burns.&nbsp; At
this occasion, it is a tradition that you drink whiskey and eat haggus, the
inside of a lamb I think, which is what we did.&nbsp; Some people even recited
some of his poems while we were eating, which was nice.&quot;&nbsp; In his
e-mail, Tarek also said, &quot;I just found out yesterday (Monday, January 24)
that I will be playing my first game with the Edinburgh University basketball
team.&nbsp; The game will be played on Wednsday against Strouthclyde.&nbsp; The
top two Scottish teams, Strouthclyde (the Scottish champions) and us, will be
playing in a tournament which includes the top English and Welsh universities to
determine the British champions.&nbsp; Wednsday's game is a friendly, but we are
all looking forward for it, because Strouthclyde is the only team that has
beaten us so far.&quot;</font></p>
