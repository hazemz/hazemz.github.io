Remember Umm Harran</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Exactly three
years have passed since the passing away of Umm Harran on Wednesday, July 30,
1997.&nbsp; In remembrance of the late Umm Harran, some Zureikats may be
visiting the Umm Harran Gazebo, which was built in Ajlun in 1998.&nbsp; The
family had visited the gazebo on July 30, 1998 and 1999.&nbsp; On this occasion,
Mona sent the following e-mail to The Zureikat Weekly:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="mona.jpg" width="105" height="82"></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial"><i>&quot;</i></font><font face="Arial"><i>To Umm
Harran,<br>
It still hurts that you are not there on the other end,<br>
Your memory will last forever and ever,<br>
Because you are the breeze of my summer wind!<br>
Your daughter,<br>
Mona&quot;</i></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Marwan also sent
the following message to The Zureikat Weekly:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="marwan.jpg" width="105" height="82"></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><i><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Twenty
years ago, I was attending a lecture about stress and relaxation.&nbsp; The
lecturer asked each one of the attendants to lie down and try and recall moments
in his life where he enjoyed complete peace of mind and relaxation.&nbsp; The
idea was that if one wants to relax, one of the best ways would be to try and
carry himself back in time to a place where he generally feels comfortable,
relaxed, happy, content, satisfied, and has a peace of mind.&nbsp; For me, that
place was always sitting in the veranda of my mother's house opposite my mother
and enjoying the love and affection that she always kept around her wherever she
went and whatever she did.&quot;</font></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><i><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;I never
took my mother to be a &quot;great&quot; person.&nbsp; For me, she was a simple,
loving mother whose only mission in life is to take away from herself and give
to her children and family.&nbsp; Only after her death did I realize that my
mother was truly a &quot;great&quot; person.&nbsp; It is now after her death
that we all realize how much she meant to each one of us and how much she
affected our lives.&nbsp; The Zureikat Weekly is only but one testimony to the
greatness of Umm Harran.&nbsp; It carries with it the message that Umm Harran
lived for all her life.&nbsp; &quot;Nothing in life equals a happy, loving, and
united family&quot;.&quot;&nbsp;</font></i></p>
