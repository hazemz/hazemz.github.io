preparations, Cyber Kids - Amman, with Abla N. as its Educational Director, held
its First Electronic Art Fair at the Royal Cultural Center in Amman under the
patronage of HRH Prince Faisal bin Al-Hussein on Thursday, April 27, 2000.&nbsp;
The fair included projects which were created on the computer by Cyber Kids
students.&nbsp; What should be mentioned is that Cyber Kids is a franchise,
first established in Cyprus.&nbsp; Its main purpose is using the computer as a
tool in learning, just like a paper and a pen.&nbsp; The fair, which was only
five hours long, was described as being &quot;very successful&quot;.&nbsp; The
fair was mentioned in the 6 o'clock news on Friday, April 28, and in major
Jordanian daily newspapers.</font></p>
