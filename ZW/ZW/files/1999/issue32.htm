Reema</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Celebrating the Kids Broadcasting

Friday, December 10, 1999.&nbsp; Following are the two interviews:</font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Alia's Interview</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img src="alia.jpg"

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">Q. Alia, tell us about your
disability.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="3" face="Arial">A.
I suffer from Cerebral Palsy, which is when the nerve cells in the brain are
damaged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, as a
consequence, I have motor difficulties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
walk on two sticks, and I also wear hearing aids.</font></span></p>

</o:p></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Q.
Alia, you went to regular
school and now you’re studying at university.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tell me, how did you manage to cope with all that?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="3">A. At first, it was very
difficult because people reacted to me in different ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was regarded, at first, as a disabled person and not as an individual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But, as time went by, they began to understand that I’m a human being
with the same emotional needs of everybody else, and we actually started to
change; they started to accept me, I began having equal opportunities, equal
chances, I never felt any different.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">***<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Q.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Who do you feel gave the most support while you were growing up?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A.
I believe my parents’ continuous love, support, and encouragement helped me a
great deal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They accepted the
situation, and they taught me how to accept the situation, and they were
persistent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They told me that
everything has a reward through hard work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They told me the truth; they never lied to me.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>So, yes, I think in that way I’ve come a long way.</span></font></p>

</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Q.
Alia, can you please tell me about the most memorable moment in your life.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A.
That would have to be when I was about ten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was when I took my first step when I was doing physiotherapy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was the first moment I took my first step.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was very, very memorable, very, very special.</span></font></p>

</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Q.
How understanding do you feel people are to your disability?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A.
As I said before, back then, I had a lot of negative responses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>People only saw my disability and never saw me as a person, and this is
changing because people are learning that disabled people are human beings,
firstly and foremost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, I think
society in Jordan is in the process of changing, but we still have a long way to
go.</span></font></p>

</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Q.
So you are the Representative of Disabled Persons on campus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>How do you come about this title?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A.
Basically, in the first year, the Student Union at Royal Holloway elected the
Disabled Representative, and this representative speaks on behalf of all other
disabled people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We are here to
make sure that equal rights and equal opportunities are given to each and every
student to make sure that disabled people have their needs met.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And unfortunately, because the campus in not 100% accessible, we have to
work around accessibility in this area.</span></font></p>

Alia, what are your future plans?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A.
I’d like to pursue a Masters degree in International Law and hopefully
continue to be an advocate for the rights of disabled people in Jordan.</span></font><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><o:p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Q. We just heard Alia talking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tell us, how do you feel about this?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A.
At this moment, I’m very happy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
think we’re getting a lot of results of hard work, persistence, and
achievement of Alia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Alia now is a
functional person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She’s
productive.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She’s integrated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
has the right of choices, and she has a life of her own and hopes to the future.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Q.
Alia’s mother is a member of the Family and Friends Society of Persons with
Disabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tell us about this
society and the need to have it.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A.
Our society is a support group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
lot of parents suffer from denial, shocks, depression of having a child with
disabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now we are concerned
with the awareness issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Early
acceptance, early detection, and intervention lead to better results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quality rehabilitation might avoid forming secondary disabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A lot of parents get coiled up with their depression and fear of the
unknown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They don’t know how to
handle such a situation, thus wasting the first golden years of a child’s
life, which are the first five very important years for the child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So we are a support group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
have parents who feel ashamed of having a child with disabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They are stigmatized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
are negative attitudes towards the child with disabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We form a support group to the parents in this respect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We try to tell them that they are human beings, in the first place, with
a disability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They have to enjoy
their rights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A lot of them are
ignorant of their rights; they’re ignorant of the Law for the Welfare of
Disabled Persons for the year 1993.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, in this respect, we are a pressure group to enforce the law and
to enforce the rights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And a lot of
parents, unfortunately, are quite ignorant of all this.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Q.
How did you become involved in this group?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A.
I’m a mother, in the first place, and you’re talking about 21 years ago, at
the time when there were no support groups what so ever, there was no proper
rehabilitation at the time, and I had to be trained how to work with my
daughter, physiotherapy in particular, and I had to perform it daily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was hard work.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It was quite challenging, but, thank God, we managed to reach
a stage whereby Alia is functional now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
I wanted to work in support of those who are unprivileged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And they don’t have the support of their family that I had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I had all the support of the family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I had all the understanding of my family, Alia as well, and this helped a
lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I believe we can be good
advocates to such issues as acceptance and getting rid of this stigma.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A.
To start with, we have a parents meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
works like a group therapy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
exchange their ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They exchange
their experiences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We have programs
like the Tuesday School, which caters for the physically handicapped, and the
Friendship Club, which caters for the mentally handicapped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They do a lot of activities like music, gardening, arts, cooking, daily
living activities.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A lot of the children would love to boil a cup of coffee, but
they are forbidden simply because the mother in living in fear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They are overprotective for their children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We have a preschool club for the four year olds till the six year olds,
whereby they come, and they have individual programs to meet each and every
child’s needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We have services
like therapeutic horse riding; we are members in the Jordanian Therapeutic Horse
Riding Club.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And last, but not
least, we have the Portage, which is training mothers at home, whereby a trained
home visitor visits the mother of a child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The targeted group is mentally challenged children from the date of birth
till nine years of age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The home
visitor trains the mother on how to handle her child according to an educational
kit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s an early intervention
program, and our unit is quite successful.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A.
To deal with the matter as a fact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
sooner you accept the disability, the better you are.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And to realize that you are a human being and there is an
ability rather than to look at the disability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
