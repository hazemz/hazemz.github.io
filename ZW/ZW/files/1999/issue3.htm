Morocco</font></big></big></p>

family&quot;</font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">On an assignment for the Swedish government, Mona left
for Egypt and Morocco two weeks ago to attend seminars there.&nbsp; After returning to
Stockholm on May 5, Mona wrote an e-mail to The Zureikat Weekly telling us about her trip.
&nbsp; In her e-mail, Mona said, <font size="3">&quot;I came back from a long trip to
Egypt and Morocco.&nbsp; It has been great to be in Rabat, Fez, Miknas and Walily,
beautiful cities of Andalus.&nbsp; I felt the great history of the Arabs and listened to
Andalusian songs and music.&nbsp; Besides it was great to feel the Soofism and philosophy
everywhere.&nbsp; Morocco is the place I recommend to all of you.&quot;&nbsp; In her
e-mail, Mona also expressed her happiness after hearing that Amal was recovering quickly.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In her weekly e-mail to The Zureikat Weekly, Hala said
that she, Naief and the kids will be returning to Amman sometime between June 3 and June
10, 1999.&nbsp; In her e-mail, Hala also included her news there.&nbsp; &quot;The summer
swimming pools are now open in our apartment complex.&nbsp; The children enjoyed the water
yesterday (Monday the 3rd) afternoon,&quot; she said.&nbsp; Regarding the visit of Naief's
sister Muntaha and her husband Zuheir to Birmingham, Hala said, &quot;Naief's sister and
her husband left to Georgia early morning to visit family members there.&quot;&nbsp; Hala
also asked about Amal, who underwent hysterectomy two weeks ago.&nbsp; In another e-mail
to The Zureikat Weekly, Hala said, &quot;Dalia's class celebrated Mother's Day.&nbsp; I
attended a very nice party in her classroom and they offered us some hand-made presents.
&nbsp; Dalia said that my mother deserves to be the mother of the years because she helps
me in everything and she cares then she said an acrostic (M for music, O for original, T
for thinks, H for honest, E for eager and R for responsible.&nbsp; That makes a nice poem
for Mother).&nbsp; Also Naief was invited two weeks ago to attend breakfast with Dalia in
her classroom celebrating Father's Day.&nbsp; We might go this weekend to Six Flags in
Atlanta.&quot;&nbsp; On the other hand, Reema and her driver Mohammad checked on Hala's
house in Amman last week.&nbsp; Reema told The Zureikat Weekly that everything was fine
there.</font></p>
