<p align="left"><font face="Arial">On April 15, 1999, Talal was interviewed to
attend one of the seven United World Colleges this year to complete his IB
diploma. The interview came after a series of exams that Talal had to sit for
and he was chosen with 19 other students of his age from a huge group of 500
students to be eligible for the scholarship.&nbsp; The results of the interview
stated that Talal was a first runner-up for the scholarship, i.e. if any of the
chosen students refuse to accept the scholarship, he will be granted it
instead.&nbsp; Last week, one of the students who were chosen for the
scholarship returned to Amman after &quot;misbehaving&quot;, therefore, Talal
was supposed to take her place in Italy.&nbsp; In a phone call with The Zureikat
Weekly, Amal said that the president of the UWC said that there are &quot;many
boys in the college&quot; and that they wanted girls.&nbsp; Amal also said that
despite what the president said, the Italian Embassy in Amman is trying its best
so Talal still has a chance to attend UWC.&nbsp; What should be mentioned here
is that Bana was previously granted the same scholarship three years ago to
attend the UWC of the Atlantic in Wales.&nbsp; She graduated in May 1998.</font></p>
