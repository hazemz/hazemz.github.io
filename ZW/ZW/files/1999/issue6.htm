<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Last Thursday, May 20, 1999, Tarek won the elections
for president of the Arab Society in Edinburgh which was started by a Lebanese girl one
year ago.&nbsp; Tarek's opponent in the elections was Mohammad Al-Qasem, a Jordanian PHD
student.&nbsp; Tarek will start his new job as president next year (October 1999).&nbsp;
In an exclusive interview with The Zureikat Weekly, Tarek said, &quot;the theme for the
society was, (no politics, just socializing).&nbsp; Some of my friends and I found that to
be a bit disturbing since there are things going on in the Arab World which&nbsp;
you&nbsp; can't&nbsp; pretend they don't exist.&quot;&nbsp; Tarek also said that he had
decided to run for president after Professor Edward Sa'id from Yale University came to the
Arab Society in Edinburgh and decided not to advertise it because of its theme.&nbsp; In
the interview, Tarek included some of his plans for the society. &nbsp; &quot;Here are
some of the new things I am planning to do,&quot; he said, &quot;1. Get some Arabic
newspapers to be sold at a discount in the university.&nbsp; (The ones we have are very
expensive for some students). - 2. Invite guest speakers to talk about certain issues
facing the Arab world. - 3. Make a web site for the society which includes a discussion
section similar to the one in Jordan, where a student would write an article about a
particular subject, and then other students would comment on the article.&nbsp; Then you
would have a debate on the web.&nbsp; We can advertise this if it works, to all the Arab
Societies in Britain. - 4. A bulletin board for the Arab Society which will include
articles that some Arabic student thought would be of interest to other Arab students. -
5. Continue with social events to promote the Arabic culture&nbsp; to Arabs and non-Arabs
- 6. Have a close coordination with GAPS.&nbsp; I know&nbsp; their president and some of
their members.&quot;&nbsp; At the end of the interview, Tarek said, &quot;I welcome any
suggestion from the Zureikats.&quot;&nbsp; On the other hand, Zureikats all around the
world congratulated Tarek on winning the elections.&nbsp; Family members in Jordan
expressed their congratulations to Tarek in phone calls to Marwan's house.&nbsp; In an
e-mail to The Zureikat Weekly, Mona said, &quot;we wish the very best for Tarek in his new
endeavor.&quot;&nbsp; Hala also told The Zureikat Weekly that she will be writing Tarek an
e-mail to congratulate him.&nbsp; In another e-mail to The Zureikat Weekly, Reem said,
&quot;he deserves all the best.&quot;</font></p>

Regarding the party, Hala said, &quot;we went this afternoon with Dalia's class to their
end of school party at the Bowling Club.&nbsp; It was very nice. &nbsp; Salem and Deena
have scored many points.&nbsp; At the end of the party, the teacher gave the students
their awards.&nbsp; Dalia has been chosen by the members of her fourth grade class as
Nicest Smile for 1998-1999.&nbsp; Then, the teacher, in her farewell speech to the class,
