<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The Editor in Chief of The Zureikat Weekly made an
exclusive interview with Hala almost two weeks after her return from Birmingham, Alabama.
&nbsp; The interview took place at Amal's house on Tuesday, June 22, 1999.&nbsp; In the
interview, Hala said that she has missed the family here in Amman after spending all this
time in the States and is very happy to see them.&nbsp; Hala also said that she missed all
the soirees the family had.&nbsp; &quot;We are happy to see the family,&quot; she said,
&quot;but life was much better in Birmingham, for us and for the kids.&nbsp; The apartment
was better, we had a nice view and there were trees, pools and playgrounds
everywhere.&nbsp; I managed living with the kids there without any help.&nbsp; Life was
easier and the children were much more happier in their social life (they had many friends
even in the neighborhood) and their school life.&nbsp; Cleaning the apartment was much
easier, even shopping.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;We used to sit as a family, together, there
without any (nakad),&quot; she continued, &quot;Dalia and Deena miss the teachers and
their classmates.&quot;&nbsp; In the interview, Hala told The Zureikat Weekly about what
she and her family did every day from morning to night.&nbsp; She said, &quot;Everyone
wakes up at 6:30 AM.&nbsp; The girls dress by themselves and we have our Turkish Coffee
then we all eat Corn Flakes for our breakfast.&nbsp; At 7:30, I take Dalia and Deena to
the bus stop near our complex then I return home and watch Good Morning America on
ABC.&nbsp; If Salem had to go to daycare, Naief and I take him at 9:30 AM.&nbsp; We later
go to UAB (The University of Alabama at Birmingham), I drop Naief, who works there, and I
go to a sports center, unless Salem didn't go to daycare.&nbsp; I walk one hour on the
treadmill, excerise for half an hour and swim for another hour or so.&nbsp; After I shower
and dress, I get Salem from daycare at about 1:30 PM.&nbsp; We return home and I go get
Naief, along with Salem, at 3:00 or 6:00 PM (it depends on when he finishes).&nbsp; Dalia
and Deena return home at 4:00 and have some snacks.&nbsp; Then, I prepare dinner and we
eat at about 6:00 PM.&quot;&nbsp; Hala also told us about their program in the weekends.
&nbsp; &quot;On Saturdays,&quot; she said, &quot;we used to take it easy.&nbsp; We wake up
a little late.&nbsp; Our main activity for that day is either shopping or going on a
picnic.&nbsp; We return at about 6:00 PM and the children sleep at 10:00.&quot; &nbsp;
&quot;As for Sunday,&quot; she continued, &quot;we go to church in the morning. &nbsp; In
the afternoon, we either go to a restaurant or visit some friends.&quot; &nbsp; Hala
concluded the interview by congratulating the Editor in Chief on the release of the 10th
issue of The Zureikat Weekly.</font></p>
