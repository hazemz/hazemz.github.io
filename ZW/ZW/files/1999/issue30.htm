<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4">Alia reveals her plans as the new
Disabled Representative</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img src="alia.jpg"
width="170" height="127"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Alia, who became the new Disabled
Representative at Royal Holloway a few weeks ago, sent an e-mail to The Zureikat Weekly.&nbsp;
In
her e-mail, Alia said, &quot;Yesterday, (Friday, November 5) was the beginning
of Reading Week; a week where we have no lectures in order to be able to catch
up on all the work, etc.&nbsp; I'm going to Hemel Hempstead, an area in the
north of London, for five days to do intensive physiotherapy (2 hours everyday),
and I'm taking a friend of mine along.&nbsp; We will be staying at a hotel
(Yahoo!!).&nbsp; Hopefully, I'll do some exercises, work and manage to have a good time as well!&quot;&nbsp;
The Zureikat Weekly has learned that Alia and her friend have returned to London
after spending a few days in Hemel Hempstead.&nbsp; Regarding
her new post as the Disabled Representative, Alia said, &quot;As the new
Disabled Representative at university, I will soon have a lot to do.&nbsp; As it
is a job I'll be doing in collaboration with another friend of mine, it won't be
very demanding, I hope!!&nbsp; Basically, Tanya and I are responsible for making
sure that every student with special needs is granted the extra assistance
he/she needs and deserves to make life easier for them, as the campus is huge
and not 100% accessible, unfortunately.&nbsp; We will also be responsible for
several functions that are to be carried out at the Student Union of the
university.&nbsp; Such activities include The Disability Awareness Day, where
we, along with all the other DR's of other universities in the country, organize
activities that are based on the everyday life of disabled people (e.g.
strapping students to wheelchairs and making race one another around&nbsp; the
campus!!) so that they understand and appreciate how<br>
difficult it is for us to move about campus.&quot;</font></p>
