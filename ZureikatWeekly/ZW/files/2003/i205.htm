anniversary on Wednesday, April 23, 2003.&nbsp; Many would agree that the ZW's 
fourth year wasn't 'just another year'.&nbsp; Most of this year's issues were 
released from the US.&nbsp; Another major change that the newsletter underwent, 
as a result, was the appointment of Correspondents and Photographers.&nbsp; 
The Weekly, since then, has become the result of a remarkable group effort.&nbsp; On this 
occasion, the Editor in Chief of The Zureikat Weekly would like to thank the 
Correspondents, Photographers, and readers of the ZW for what they have been 
doing to keep our newsletter lively and interesting.</font></p>
