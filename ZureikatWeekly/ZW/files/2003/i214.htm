<font face="Arial">Hala has been awarded the Hubert Humphrey fellowship to 
attend the class of 2003-2004 at the University of Maryland at College Park, in the US.&nbsp; 
This comes a few weeks after Naief was awarded the Distinguished Scholarship 
Award from the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development (based in Kuwait) 
to teach and do research at the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.&nbsp; 
In a phone call with the Editor in Chief, Hala ruled out staying alone with the children in Maryland while Naief stayed 
in Columbus.&nbsp; She said that Naief has already started searching for another 
university in Washington DC (near Maryland) where he can teach and do his 
research.&nbsp; &quot;If it does not work out for him,&quot; she said, &quot;I would reject the 
scholarship and go with him to Columbus.&nbsp; I ask all Zureikats to help me 
find a solution.&nbsp; We have less than a month to decide.&quot;&nbsp; The Zureikat 
Weekly would like to take this opportunity to congratulate both Hala and Naief 
on their awards and wish them and their family all the best.</font></p>
