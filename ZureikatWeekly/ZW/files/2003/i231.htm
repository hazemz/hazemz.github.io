Hired at PR Company</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">More than four months after moving 
to Chicago, Leanne has been hired at Ogilvy Public Relations, one of the biggest 
PR companies in the US.&nbsp; She is expected to start her new job on Monday, 
October 27, 2003.&nbsp; In an e-mail she sent to the Editor in Chief, Leanne 
said, &quot;Things are looking up for us.&nbsp; Needless to say, I will have to 
dedicate less time to cooking, and, in my defense, I must say that Amer's 
silence regarding my cooking is by no means proof of my 'bad' cooking.&nbsp; The 
reason he has not commented is simply due to the fact that he has not had a day 
of [rest] in a few weeks and is so exhausted!&nbsp; You will be hearing from him 
soon, and once I get back I shall invite all Zureikats for a dinner which I 
shall host personally, and the menu will consist of several creative dishes that 
I have invented over the past few months!!&quot;</font></p>

Hazem made a four-day visit to Washington, DC.&nbsp; What should be mentioned is 
that Rockville, Maryland (where Hala and the family live) and Arlington, 
Virginia (where Dana and Ammar live) are both suburbs of Washington, DC.&nbsp;

arriving in Bristol late last month.&nbsp; Following is the full text of

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">A month has passed, and I am 
finally settled in.&nbsp; Everything is just the way I wanted it to be, and I am 
enjoying the student life.&nbsp; I have come to realize that I owe my family a 
thanks for making me the person I am.&nbsp; I would like to thank my mother and 
father for everything they have done; without you, I wouldn't be the person I 
am.&nbsp; You have made such a positive impact on my life, and I will be forever 
grateful.&nbsp; It is true you never realize how important something is until 
you finally leave it.&nbsp; I thank you for everything you have given and 
shared.&nbsp; You are what I have always wanted to be, and it is through you 
that I find my strength, willpower, and determination to reach for the highest 
goal.&nbsp; I will achieve it.&nbsp; Zraigo and Leanne, I love you guys.&nbsp; 
Amer, after all the beatings I have suffered and all the hardships you suffered 
in university, I now learn the meaning of being a man.&nbsp; As I have said, you 
are more than a brother, but also a figure which I look up to.&nbsp; Alia, it is 
your ability that made me see my disability.&nbsp; You have been through so much 
yet always managed to keep a smile on your face.&nbsp; You are a true idol and 
it is through you that I see the impossible as a mere state of mind.&nbsp; All 
the Zureikats, I love you all.&nbsp; Each and every one of us is lucky to have 
been brought up in such a family.&nbsp; Tahya lil Karak wa Ajloun.</font></i></p>

Holds Annual Breakfast for FFSPD</font></p>

<p align="center" dir="ltr"><img border="0" src="reema.jpg" width="190" height="142"></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Reema held the annual breakfast 
charity event for the Families and Friends Society for Persons with Disabilities 
(FFSPD) at the Le Royale Hotel in Amman on Saturday, October 25, 2003.&nbsp; The 
event was patronized by HRH Princess Mona Al-Hussein and was attended by HRH 
Princess Majda Raad and Jordanian singer and Superstar, Diana Carazon.&nbsp; In 
her weekly e-mail to the Editor in Chief, Alia said, &quot;The event was centered 
around the portage program (one of the society's 6 programs) which is the 
home-visiting program and its newly established KG, which was initiated by Suad 
Aloul, one of FFSPD's members, who died 2 months ago from cancer.&nbsp; Reema 
was the main speaker, talking about Suad and her endless energy and how much she 
gave, quoting Gibran Khalil Gibran on several occasions, followed by two mothers 
of children with disabilities, who spoke about how the society, Reema, and Suad 
have given meaning to their children's lives and theirs!&nbsp; Princess Mona 
also awarded several members of FFSPD, the two mothers, children, and staff who 
have contributed in one way or another, in addition to a number of donors and 
supporters.&quot;</font></p>
