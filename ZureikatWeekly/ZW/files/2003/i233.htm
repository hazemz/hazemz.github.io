Discontinuing ZW</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">In a debate that has  been gradually taking place for the past 
year or so regarding the future of The Zureikat Weekly, Marwan sent an open 
letter to the Editor in Chief suggesting that now is the right time &quot;to consider 
stopping the issue of the Weekly&quot;.&nbsp; The Editor in Chief would like to take 
this opportunity to ask all Zureikats to send their opinions on this issue.&nbsp; 
A decision on such an issue is not an easy one to make and should be carefully 
considered.&nbsp; Following is the full text of Marwan's e-mail:</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Dear Hazem,</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">I have hesitated a lot before I 
decided to write this letter to you.&nbsp; I have been regularly reading The 
Zureikat Weekly issues and never stopped admiring the effort and the dedication 
that is needed to keep this web magazine running weekly, non-stop, for over 4.5 
years.&nbsp; However, I consider it the right time now to consider stopping the 
issue of the Weekly and/or consider other options to maintain flow of the family 
news and information.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">It is no secret that the Weekly was 
intended to maintain and keep our family culture and values.&nbsp; It is not a 
coincidence that the Weekly was thought of and initiated by you after the 
passing away of your grandmother.&nbsp; It was one expression of your and our 
desire to keep her memory and what she stood for alive and living with us.&nbsp; 
But with the passing of time, things change.&nbsp; The family grows, and people 
age.&nbsp; The bonds that used to tie the family become overshadowed by other 
priorities and interests.&nbsp; It is a fact now that some of us have no 
relationship with the Weekly at all.&nbsp; Others do not read it, and many do 
not contribute to it.&nbsp; To keep forcing the Weekly would, in my mind, be 
like working against the tide and may result in negative consequences.&nbsp; It 
is great to maintain and keep our family values and culture, but this is 
something that we should not force and must leave for each of the smaller 
Zureikat family units to deal with in the manner they deem convenient to them.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The Zureikat Weekly has done a 
great job.&nbsp; Its significance and value are huge.&nbsp; In the future, we 
will all look back at it and be proud of it.&nbsp; It will serve as an example 
for those who will follow us.&nbsp; For me, it has shown, more than anything 
else, how much of a difference a single individual can make given the dedication 
and commitment that you have shown.&nbsp; I am certainly a proud father and a 
proud Zureikat.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">I leave it to you to consider this 
issue and make whatever decision you deem appropriate.</font></p>

of our honeymoon.&nbsp; The weather was fine, except the first day, it was cold.&nbsp; 
We visited the Prado Museum and did half day tours.&nbsp; We missed the plane 
from Paris to Amman, so we had to fly to Frankfurt, and guess who was on board 
next to me?&nbsp; Giscard d’Estaing, the former President of France, so I sat 
with him for 20 minutes talking about Iraq, Jordan, and Palestine.&nbsp; It made
