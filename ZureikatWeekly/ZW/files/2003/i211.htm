4, 2003, Jordanian Consulting Engineer Co. officially received the Ministry of 
Public Works and Housing Award for Distinguished Performance in Consulting Work 
for 2001.&nbsp; The ceremony included speeches by several people in the field 
including Marwan and Mr. Husni Abu Gheida, the Minister of Public Works and 
Housing.&nbsp; In his speech, Marwan said that earning this award wasn't only 
the result of hard work and perseverance that the JCE staff demonstrated, but 
that it was also the result of continued support from the institutions in the 
engineering and consulting fields in Jordan.&nbsp; What should be mentioned is 
that The Zureikat Weekly announced that JCE had won the award last March.&nbsp; 
The ceremony, however, was not held until last Wednesday.&nbsp; The award was 
given to JCE for their work on the Lajjoun Water Supply Project, a major water 
supply project valued at nearly US$40 million.&nbsp; JCE managed to complete the 
designs and carry out the supervision of this project in a record 9 months.&nbsp; 
Once again, The Zureikat Weekly would like to take this opportunity to 
congratulate Marwan and the JCE staff on winning this prestigious award.</font></p>
