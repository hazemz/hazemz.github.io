<font face="Arial">Mona returned to Sweden after spending ten days in Oman where 
she attended the Omar Book Fair.&nbsp; Mona left Sweden on Monday, February 24, 
and returned on Thursday, March 6, 2003.&nbsp; In her weekly e-mail to the 
Editor in Chief, Mona said, &quot;It was very beautiful, and the people were very 
nice.&nbsp; I was both on TV and the radio, and a Swedish flag flew outside the 
book fair high up in the sky to give a mark that Sweden is participating.&nbsp; 
It looked very thrilling.&nbsp; Sylvia came over in my absence to stay over the 
weekend with Gero, and she had a good time in seeing all her old friends.&nbsp; 
Dag picked me up from the airport, and we all gathered on a nice evening
dinner prepared by Gero.&quot;&nbsp; In her e-mail, Mona also sent her regards to 
Dana and Ammar.&nbsp; &quot;We look forward to
seeing them both in Sweden soon,&quot; she said.</font></p>
