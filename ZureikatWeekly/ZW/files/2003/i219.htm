<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">August 2, 2003...another milestone 
in Zureikat history, as family and friends from all over the world gathered in 
Washington, DC to attend the wedding of Dana and Ammar (dubbed by many as 'a 
royal wedding').&nbsp; The festivities 
began two days earlier, when Marwan and Abla hosted a Mediterranean evening at 
Nayla (a Lebanese restaurant in Washington).&nbsp; A bridal shower was also held 
at the Ritz Carlton the next day.&nbsp; Ammar's parents, Mr. Fahhad and Mrs. 
Ayda Daoud, hosted a post-wedding brunch on Sunday, August 3, 2003, at Sequoia 
Restaurant in the Washington Harbor area.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">At about 4:15pm, buses and 
limousines left the Latham Hotel in Georgetown for the St. Sophia Greek Orthodox 
Cathedral.&nbsp; The service began a bit after 5pm.&nbsp; Ammar's parents entered, 
followed by Abla and Tarek, the five groomsmen (who included Tarek and Hazem), 
the five bride's maids, the best man (Basheer Daoud, Ammar's brother) and the 
maid of honor (Lara Ghaleb Zureikat).&nbsp; Then, of course, came the bride 
accompanied by Marwan.</font></p>

<p align="center" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="4">Reception</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">After the church service, the 
wedding party moved to the City Museum of Washington, DC, where cocktails and 
canapés were served on the top floor.</font></p>

<p align="center" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 14pt">Dinner</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Everyone moved to the bottom floor 
of the museum at about 7:30pm for the seated wedding dinner.&nbsp; Dana and 
Ammar then entered the hall and danced on Tonight (by Frank Sinatra).&nbsp; The 
dance was followed by a speech given by Marwan in which he talked about what the 
treasure of love can do in bringing two people, a family, or even a whole 
organization together.&nbsp; He said that love, to him, is the &quot;king of kings 
and the lord of lords&quot;.&nbsp; A blessing by Father George followed the speech, 
and dinner was served.&nbsp; Shortly after dinner, Dana and Marwan danced on 
Unforgettable (by Nat King Cole).&nbsp; This was followed by the cake-cutting 
ceremony.&nbsp; Dancing continued until the wedding dinner ended at midnight.</font></p>
