I really enjoyed it.&nbsp; Tarek and Bana, thanks for everything!!&nbsp; On the 
second night, after a day filled with mu3ayadat from the Zureikats, (Got lots of 
flowers and presents from il 3amat and the Marwan household.&nbsp; The fact that 
Dana also called me from the US made my big day even more special.&nbsp; I'd 
like to thank her and Reem for remembering!!), a close friend of mine, Nada Al 
Hassan, arranged for a beautiful dinner party at Houston's.&nbsp; Amer and 
Leanne also came.&nbsp; It was beautiful.&nbsp; (Ammo Marwan, they all loved the
