<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Hi Hazem,</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">...I feel it would be a great shame to 
discontinue [&quot;our weekly&quot;].&nbsp; As Dag has said, it is a great source of 
comfort for those abroad.&nbsp; It is also our legacy and a constant reminder of 
the bonds that unite us.&nbsp; Having said that, sending their weekly news to 
you seems to be somewhat difficult to some Zureikats, particularly as we all are 
busy with work, studies, etc.&nbsp; Therefore, I recommend that the weekly 
becomes a bi-weekly.&nbsp; Perhaps you could send out a questionnaire, 
recommending future changes, for everyone to fill out.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Dear Zureikats,</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I urge you all not to kill such a beautiful 
and resourceful innovation that, with a little more cooperation from your part 
coupled with Hazem's creativity, could continue to be our source of pride and 
inspiration for many more years to come.&nbsp; Many thanks to you all...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I have read Marwan's letter.&nbsp; I don't 
agree with him at all.&nbsp; This ZW was an inspiration to all members, 
especially to the ones who live outside Amman.&nbsp; It is a great commitment 
and effort which has taken lots of your time to make someone happy.&nbsp; Is not 
that enough reason to continue?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Hi Hazem,</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I read Uncle Marwan's letter, and I have to 
say it would be sad if you stop publishing The Zureikat Weekly.&nbsp; It is for 
us Hennings/Zureikats living abroad a very good way to stay close to the family 
in Jordan.&nbsp; Even the slightest news like Marwan's tooth operation is 
interesting.&nbsp; Keep up the good work you do.&nbsp; Maybe instead of a weekly 
newsletter, do a monthly or every second week instead, then you have more time 
to collect more news material and pictures.&nbsp; Just a suggestion.&nbsp; I 
like what you are doing, and I support you...</font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&quot;Our Family Diary&quot;<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial"><i>a half decade of recorded family history and 
still growing...</i></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">My father's words were very harsh...too harsh 
in fact.&nbsp; My heart was racing as I read his letter.&nbsp; Although, I tend 
to agree with him most of the time, I'm afraid I don't regarding ceasing the 
publication of our dear &quot;ZW&quot;.&nbsp; My father may have a different perspective 
seeing it from Jordan, but you have to take the opinion of the Zureikats living 
abroad into consideration.&nbsp; We do constitute almost fifty percent today, 
i.e. huge lobby you're dealing with here!&nbsp; We look forward to the weekly 
issue and find it extremely enjoyable to read no matter how little or how much 
the content of each issue is.&nbsp; We have to realize that the ZW cannot be 
rich in its every issue since we don't always have breaking news on a weekly 
basis, but the consistency itself is a significant element here.&nbsp; I bet you 
we all grin and smile when we find it in our inbox and open it with great 
anticipation.&nbsp; Isn't that an act of greatness in itself?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">To give an example, I personally cried so 
much for not being able to attend Amer's wedding but felt like I was among the 
family as soon as Hazem sent the ZW out.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Ammar and I have discussed what my father had 
written in the ZW's previous issue and believe that maybe now is a good time to 
build on what has already been achieved.&nbsp; We should contribute differently 
and add value to the publication.&nbsp; For example, we can have a column on 
political views by Tarek Zureikat, or a section relating to news from Sweden by 
Mona Henning, etc. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">What do you think?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Dearest Hazem,</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">...I have been thinking all this week about 
[&quot;Marwan's letter to you&quot;], and I felt really sorry if you would listen to him 
and stop the magazine.&nbsp; The only thing I agree with him is you might think 
of making it bi-weekly or monthly.&nbsp; This is up to you.&nbsp; Also, it is up 
to you to stop it if you feel tired, and maybe in this case somebody else (which 
I don't like, because I don't think any of us has the qualities of consistency 
like you) can replace you.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Marwan mentioned the culture and values of 
our family which my mother fought for all her life.&nbsp; I think we should work 
on to keep these values for the grand grand children.&nbsp; Even if the family 
grows, and the priorities for each one of us are different, but still we have to 
keep this unity through the ZWeekly.&nbsp; We don't meet all of us weekly or 
monthly, as do some other families I know in Amman.&nbsp; The ZWeekly managed to 
keep all of us informed about each other's activities, and that, by itself, is 
great.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">It was great to see all these beautiful 
pictures of Dana and Ammar and Amer and Leanne when they got married.&nbsp; We 
will be seeing more of these pictures soon for other members.&nbsp; What you are 
doing Hazem is a great archive work.&nbsp; Maybe I should mention here that a 
great French writer, Robert Solé, wrote a trilogy, three very nice stories 
about Christian families who left Syria to live in Egypt at the end of the 19th. 
century, and this was based on the memories of a Syrian journalist at that time, 
describing the day to day life of his family.&nbsp; The work you are doing is a 
great one, and we should keep it.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Again, it is up to you Hazem, but this is 
really what I think.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Hi everyone,</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Hope all is well.&nbsp; Well I must say that 
Ammo Marwan's e-mail came as a shock when I opened the Weekly last night, as I 
do every Sunday, looking forward to reading the week's news.&nbsp; As I read 
Ammo's letter, panic was being swept across the US as I broke the news to a very 
distressed Auntie Hala, who had not yet read the issue, followed by an urgent 
call from Dana!&nbsp; I think I speak on behalf of all Zureikats abroad when I 
say that the Weekly is a very important part of our lives.&nbsp; The pictures 
take us back home, and the news puts us at ease, as we are reassured that 
everyone is doing well.&nbsp; It is unfortunate that we are not all always able 
to contribute, but life sometimes gets so crazy that one doesn't have time to do 
the simplest things, but we all have time to read the Weekly, and when we do - 
as I said in one of my past emails - we mentally travel back to Amman and feel 
like we are among the family again.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I don't know any other family in Jordan that 
has such a special way of keeping in touch with each other.&nbsp; So Ammo Marwan, 
please please please change your mind.&nbsp; The Weekly is so important to us!</font></p>

Leanne</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I will be sad if The Zureikat Weekly stopped.&nbsp; 
It is my only window to hear the news of the members of the family who I do not 
hear from very often.&nbsp; But it is like all initiatives in the Arab World 
[that] die due to the lack of the team spirit.&nbsp; Success is a strange word 
for them.&nbsp; Again, I am really sad to see The Zureikat Weekly vanish away.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><i>(In a phone call with the Editor in 
Chief):</i><br>
The Zureikat Weekly is a pioneer foundation.&nbsp; It's a model to other friends 
and families.&nbsp; Stopping this pioneer foundation will sadden and shock me 
because, whether Hazem likes it or not, we've been depending on it a lot.&nbsp; 
Sometimes, one tends to take things for granted, things that he needs most and 
loves most, but aren't we all human?&nbsp; We make mistakes, and we should learn 
that we shouldn't take it for granted for longer than it takes, otherwise, we'll 
lose a beautiful way of getting in touch and the base for a family&nbsp; union.&nbsp; 
The Zureikat Weekly must never, never ever stop.&nbsp; It is a necessity.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="tarek.jpg" width="190" height="142"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Dear fellow Zureikats,</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I am writing with regards to Abu Tarek's 
e-mail.&nbsp; It seemed to have caused quite a stir.&nbsp; I do not agree with 
everything he said, but I will not be overly critical either.&nbsp; After all, 
he does pay my salary.&nbsp; However, I would<br>
like to take this opportunity to share a concern I have had for a long time.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I am the last person to be talking about the 
future of The Zureikat Weekly, because, although I am a regular reader, I have 
rarely participated any information which is something I am sure Hazem does not 
appreciate even though he, being the person that he is, would never tell me 
that.&nbsp; I look back at my time in Scotland, and I really could not imagine 
how it would have been like without The Zureikat Weekly.&nbsp; Reading all the 
news of the family, seeing the pictures of everyone, reading about myself in 
occasions as well.&nbsp; It has a special place in my heart, as I am sure it's 
the same with most other members of the ZW.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">But we must all accept a fact that I believe 
we tend to forget in occasions: Hazem is 19.&nbsp; Hazem is also a university 
student.&nbsp; Hazem has school work, societies, soon enough a girl friend (if 
he  doesn't have one by now).&nbsp; Should we really be expecting him to 
produce an issue EVERY week.&nbsp; Some might say it doesn't take a lot of time, 
but I can just imagine a Saturday night when all of us are enjoying ourselves, Hazem will be out with friends, and in the back of his mind there will always be 
the subject of this week's ZW issue.&nbsp; In many cases, he will have to call 
home and get information when there is none (no thanks to me).&nbsp; Some will 
argue that Hazem enjoys it.&nbsp; I think we will be kidding ourselves if we 
think that, after 250 issues, Hazem is excited every weekend about producing the 
next issue.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Nevertheless, the discipline and efficiency 
Hazem has shown in producing a quality issue every week is beyond me.&nbsp; I am 
sure my boss will concur that.&nbsp; Personally, and I am saying this as an 
older brother, I would be just as pleased if instead of a ZW issue, I get a 
phone call from Hazem saying: &quot;Sorry I forgot to produce this week's issue, as I 
was partying till the early hours of the morning with a Russian girl called 
Nicole&quot;.&nbsp; Obviously, this is up to Hazem, but knowing him, he has never 
said no to anybody when his help was requested.&nbsp; And being the selfless 
person he is, I am sure he will not say no if we all asked him to keep producing 
the ZW.&nbsp; Perhaps it is time for the new generation to take charge of that.&nbsp; 
There is so much energy and talent in the [younger Zureikat] generation to 
produce something similar.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">We have a great family and far too many good 
memories together that I doubt the ending of the ZW will change things 
dramatically.&nbsp; I realize that this email will upset a few people.&nbsp; I 
would love the ZW to continue.&nbsp; I am simply writing as a concerned brother, 
as I am sure Mr. Marwan was writing as a concerned father.</font></p>
