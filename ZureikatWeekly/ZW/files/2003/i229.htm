<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Hala was one of three panelists at 
an annual dinner for the Midwest IIE Office in Chicago (IIE is the Institute of 
International Education).&nbsp; At the beginning of the dinner, which was held 
on Wednesday, October 8, Hala was presented by Allan Goodman, President and CEO 
of the institute and formerly a professor at Georgetown University.&nbsp; 
Goodman talked about Hala and where she comes from, then he introduced her as 
&quot;the star of Jordan Television, Hala Zureikat&quot;.&nbsp; Hala then talked about her 
family, her brothers, and about Umm Harran and how she fought to educate her 
children.&nbsp; Hala, along with the two other panelists, later answered 
questions about the Arab-Israeli conflict and about the situation in Iraq.&nbsp; 
Many of the attendees (who were about 200-250 from &quot;al-tabaqa al-mukhmalyyah&quot; in 
the US, as Hala put it) complemented Hala at the end of the dinner.&nbsp; &quot;You 
presented the human side,&quot; they said, according to Hala.&nbsp; &quot;This is what we 
want to hear.&quot;&nbsp; Hala had arrived in Chicago on Tuesday, October 7, and 
returned to Rockville on Thursday, October 9, 2003.&nbsp; Two days after her 
return, Hala said, in a phone call with the Editor in Chief, &quot;3amtak badda3at.&nbsp; 
You can put that in The Zureikat Weekly.&quot;&nbsp; During her visit to Chicago, 
Hala also visited Amer and Leanne's apartment and spent some time with Leanne.&nbsp; 
&quot;I was happy to be the first Zureikat to visit Amer and Leanne,&quot; she said.</font></p>
