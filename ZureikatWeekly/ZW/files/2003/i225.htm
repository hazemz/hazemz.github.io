<font face="Arial">Dear Editor in Chief,</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">Thanks for the latest issue.&nbsp; It is amazing how things 
develop over time.&nbsp; I refer, of course, to the article in the Weekly 
concerning the number of Zureikats in the United States.&nbsp; I think we are at 
a time now when there are more Zureikats outside Jordan than in Jordan.&nbsp; 
This is not the only amazing thing happening.&nbsp; The news of Leanne turning 
into a good cook is also “amazing”.&nbsp; We trust Leanne's words but need to 
have others certify to the fact that she is turning into a good cook, not the 
least of which is Amer himself.&nbsp; I miss them both.</font></p>
