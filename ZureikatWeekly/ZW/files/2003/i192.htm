his very own Magloobeh.&nbsp; Bana, who was among those invited, commented on 
this event in her weekly e-mail to the Editor in Chief:</font></p>

<p align="left">
<i><font face="Arial">&quot;As you all know, some of us were honored to be asked to 
taste Tarek's Magloobeh on Friday evening.&nbsp; I would just like to say that 
Tarek's Magloobeh was one of the tastiest I had in a long time.&nbsp; What was 
so unique about the Magloobeh, as one of Tarek's friends pointed out, was that 
every bite tasted different than the one before it.&nbsp; The reason, according 
to Tarek, was that he spiced the food according to the tempo of the songs he was 
listening to (i.e. a disco song would mean he virtually spilled nut meg all over 
the rice, and a romantic song would mean hardly no spicing at all).&nbsp; 
Anyway, I would like to congratulate Tarek on this amazing feast.&nbsp; He 
managed to disregard all the phone calls from the Zureikat women to &quot;help out&quot; 
and give free tips, and cooked a great meal for 20 people.&nbsp; Tarek, we love 
you and we can't wait to taste your next dish.&quot;</font></i></p>
