<font face="Arial">Harran suffered some back pains on Monday, April 7, 2003, 
which later turned out to be a result of an acute disk prolapse at levels 4 and 
5.&nbsp; In her weekly e-mail to the Editor in Chief, Alia said, &quot;He had been 
told to rest for a few days, starting last Monday evening.&nbsp; Defying the 
pain, Harran went to work on Tuesday morning, but due to severe pains was 
brought to the ER of the hospital for an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).&nbsp; 
Defying doctors' orders, because he was &quot;much better&quot; by then, Harran managed to 
'go out' Friday night and went to work today (Saturday).&nbsp; He came back for 
his usual lunch hour, but could not return to work because the pains flared up 
again.&nbsp; All in all, Harran is doing much better now.&nbsp; No worries -- 
provided he doesn't go to Anjara tomorrow! So, let's all keep our fingers 
crossed!&quot;&nbsp; The Zureikat Weekly would like to take this opportunity to wish 
Harran a speedy recovery and all the best.</font></p>
