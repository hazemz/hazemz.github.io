<font face="Arial">Reem, who is currently in Houston, Texas, sent an e-mail to 
the Editor in Chief last week.&nbsp; In her e-mail, Reem said, &quot;I'm currently in 
Houston working at the VA (Veteran's Affair) Hospital doing a GI rotation.&nbsp; 
It's a very good experience, and I'm learning a lot, but I'm also one of the 
youngest there because everyone here does a premed degree first...I'm going to 
go to Austin this weekend and possibly visit Samer in two weeks time.&quot;&nbsp; 
Regarding her visit to Megève, France where she spent New Year's Eve, Reem said, 
&quot;Megève was very cool.&nbsp; (It's located on the border between France, Italy, 
and Switzerland.)&nbsp; I went skiing on most days and sampled the French food 
at night.&quot;&nbsp; Reem concluded her e-mail by wishing the family a Happy New 
Year and Amer good luck in his interviews.</font></p>

<font face="Arial">Dear Sir,</font></p>

<p align="left">
<font face="Arial">I must say, at the outset, that I have enjoyed reading the 
“NEW” 2003 issue of The Zureikat Weekly.&nbsp; The Weekly has now established 
itself as a professional and credible publication that makes us all a proud 
family.</font></p>

<p align="left">
<font face="Arial">I have taken note of the fact that you have commenced the 
process of selecting your team of correspondents and photographers for this 
year.&nbsp; As you are aware, I have started some months ago an argument over 
the issue of appointing Abla N. as one of the Weekly photographers.&nbsp; This 
had raised many responses from the family members.&nbsp; Some supported the 
idea, and others opposed it.&nbsp; Needless to say that the responses brought 
life and added value to the Weekly.&nbsp; Some were even enlightening like the 
letter from Ziad which introduced, for the first time, the concept or science of 
‘GENETIC PHOTOGRAPHY”.</font></p>

<p align="left">
<font face="Arial">The hidden message in my letter and in the responses that 
followed is, and will always be, LOVE.&nbsp; It is for this, and many other 
reasons, that I write to you now to ask you to give serious consideration 
towards reappointing Abla N. as a Weekly photographer.&nbsp; I am sure that this 
decision will receive the support of the majority, if not all, of the Zureikat 
family members and will serve as a modest recognition of her dedication and hard 
work during her term of service as the Weekly photographer last year.</font></p>

<p align="left">
<font face="Arial">May I take this opportunity to extend my kindest regards.</font></p>
