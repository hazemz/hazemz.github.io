Middle East</font></b></p>

<b><font face="Arial">David Owen<br>
Tuesday February 4, 2003<br>
The Guardian</font></b></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">It is deeply troubling that there is not greater public 
support for George Bush and Tony Blair's readiness to enforce the existing UN 
resolutions which cover the dismantling of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. 
In part this is because there are unlikely to be any new discoveries by the UN 
inspectors such as we saw after six years of looking in 1998. A deeper reason is 
the growing public awareness of the highly manipulative and dubiously covert way 
in which western governments have handled Saddam Hussein for the past 22 years.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">To win over public opinion there has to be recognition of 
past errors, otherwise cynicism will prevail. In truth this war, if it comes, 
will be about asserting the authority of the UN charter, as part of the 1991 
ceasefire after the Iraqi forces had been pushed out of Kuwait. It was the UN 
which ruled that Iraqi chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, as well as 
missiles, had to be destroyed. The sombre alternative to Saddam Hussein being 
seen to have triumphed is we ensure there is no chance of peace in the Middle 
East. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">The fact that the US is ready to mount another military 
invasion, risk American lives and incur formidable costs, is solely due to what 
happened in New York and Washington on September 11 2001. After Afghanistan, 
containing Islamic fundamentalist terrorism requires peace in the Middle East. 
The status quo in Iraq is neither stable in geopolitical terms nor acceptable on 
humanitarian grounds. We have another chance after 12 years' failed containment 
to prevent Iraq becoming a nuclear weapon state and the opportunity to rethink 
many of the policies that have kept the Middle East in a state of permanent 
tension with frequent wars.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">The first example of new wisdom is that the western 
democracies are no longer ignoring the Kurdish problem. British foreign policy 
has a dismal record since 1923 of believing that Iraq needs to suppress the 
Kurds to maintain the stability of the country and the region. This has to 
change and there are hopeful signs that the US negotiations are close to a 
solution based on full autonomy for the Kurdish people within Iraq and in a way 
that helps Turkey and Iran resolve their differences with their own Kurdish 
minorities.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">If honestly accepted by all the Kurds, this would be the 
essential building block for any post-war settlement in Iraq. It could help if 
the western democracies admitted to only feeble protests when Saddam Hussein 
used gas in March 1988 to kill over 5,000 Kurds in Halabja.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">In dealing with Iran, the western democracies need to 
acknowledge that by ignoring Saddam Hussein's flagrant breach of international 
law in September 1980 when he invaded Iran and then used gas warfare on the 
Iranians, we fed his megalomania. Sustaining Iraq through the eight-year 
Iran-Iraq war with information and arms was tempting, given that the Iranian 
revolution under Ayatollah Khomeini saw the taking of US diplomats as hostages 
and flagrant abuses of human rights. We hoped the Iranian revolutionary zeal 
would be burned out in a regional war, but it put the west on the wrong side of 
international law, it encouraged Saddam Hussein to believe he could invade 
Kuwait and it fostered justified bitterness inside Iran.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">The Iranian people may well over the next few years assert 
more forcibly their support for modernisation in their own country. They are 
more likely to challenge the rule of the ayatollahs if they are confident that 
any consequential instability in their own country will not be exploited by the 
western democracies. It is true that Iran is supporting international terrorism 
and developing weapons of mass destruction, but even the US cannot take on both 
Iraq and Iran simultaneously. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">Saudi Arabia would have no need for American troops on its 
territory once there is a new government in Baghdad and this would remove al-Qaida's 
main propaganda weapon.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">As for Israel, the removal of Iraqi missiles which landed on 
their territory during the Gulf war would make it easier to reach a permanent 
settlement. It is essential that President Bush promises to follow in his 
father's footsteps and reinvigorate the Middle East peace process as happened in 
Madrid in 1991. It was never credible that Bush would do this before having 
dealt with Iraq for he needs to be able to restrain Ariel Sharon. But after any 
intervention there has to be pressure on Sharon to withdraw from most 
settlements in the West Bank.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">It would help negotiations if we all admitted to Israel that 
we were wrong to have condemned its government for the bombing of Iraq's 
French-built nuclear reactor in June 1981.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">Had that action not been taken it is virtually certain that 
Iraq by now would be a nuclear weapon state and quite possibly before their 1990 
invasion of Kuwait. France was within weeks of supplying uranium to the reactor. 
If the reactor had gone critical, any future bombing would have risked radiation 
clouds over Baghdad.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">Jordan also holds the key to creating stabilising links to 
Palestine on the West Bank. A country in which over 80% are Palestinians is 
being skilfully led by King Abdullah. Indeed, Jordan could become the first 
truly democratic Arab state with the king becoming a constitutional monarch 
while perhaps holding special powers over the army. Iraq and Palestine could 
follow.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">While there are grave risks involved in once more going to 
war with Iraq, they weigh less heavily in the balance against the enormous 
opportunities for peace and stability which the aftermath of any successful war 
offers in the Middle East. To maximise those opportunities, George Bush and Tony 
Blair must not seek to profit at the expense of France and Russia, either 
politically or commercially over Iraqi oil, simply because they have not been 
prepared to fully participate either in the containment of Saddam Hussein or his 
defeat. Probably neither country will veto another security council resolution.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">President Putin is pragmatically moving towards the US 
position but is unlikely to participate militarily. President Chirac will keep 
his options open. As for Chancellor Schröder, he has locked Germany into not 
participating even if the UN supports action. We will need the help of the EU as 
well as Islamic countries in the post-war period and fortunately many are 
privately supportive. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">Iraq has demonstrated to the UK what we should have learned 
over the premature recognition of Croatia: that we cannot accept in the EU any 
system where we can be outvoted in the common foreign and security policy. 
Issues of peace and war are for each individual nation to debate and decide.

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">David Owen demonstrates the simplistic mainstream view that 
the US can physically create peace and democracy in the Middle East, ignoring 
the fact that it is America's continuous double standard involvement in the 
Middle East that has created so much hatred, and has stood in the path of peace 
in the region. </font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">I will only mention one example in which his credibility 
becomes questionable. He talks about how Iraq suppressed the Kurds, and then how 
a solution could help Turkey &quot;resolve its differences with the Kurdish 
minority&quot;. So Turkey (a US ally) does not suppress the Kurds, it only has 
&quot;differences&quot; with them. I am sure he will also argue that Israel does not 
suppress the Palestinians: they just have &quot;differences&quot; with them.<br>
