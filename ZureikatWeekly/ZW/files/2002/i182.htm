<font face="Arial">In her weekly e-mail to the Editor in Chief, Bana updated us 
on the latest regarding the olive picking season at the Shomalis.&nbsp; In her 
e-mail, Bana said, &quot;Olive picking season, once again, at the Shomali House.&nbsp; 
The Shomalis spent three days picking the olives in the orchard. The hardest 
workers, of course, were Abla and Basil, and Basil's aching back is a proof of 
it.&nbsp; It took three consecutive days to pick the olives, sort them into 
bags, and now they are awaiting at the Shomali doorstep for their turn at the 
&quot;ma3sara&quot; to be crushed.&nbsp; As this year's olive harvest has been very 
abundant, it is very difficult to find a place at the &quot;ma3sara&quot;.&nbsp; It looks 
like Basil will be spending a few nights at the factory waiting for his turn.&quot;</font></p>

<i><font face="Arial">Dear Editor in Chief,</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">Thanks for publishing my last letter to you.&nbsp; Reading 
the last issue, I am now wondering whether we have been spending a lot of time 
and effort on ZW Photographers ignoring the more important element for the 
success of the ZW.&nbsp; I am referring, of course, to the Weekly 
Correspondents.&nbsp; I was particularly alarmed by some of the news that 
appeared in the last issue.&nbsp; Some were irrelevant, others were not news at 
all, but, and this is the most important, none of them went beyond scratching 
the surface.&nbsp; I am always&nbsp; fascinated by how CNN keeps emphasizing 
that its correspondents do not merely report the event, but try hard to dig into 
it to bring about the &quot;hidden details and analysis&quot;.</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">If, for some, this appears like &quot;talking theories&quot;, I 
refer to the lunch at the Karadshehs on November 8.&nbsp; In the ZW, the news of 
this event was a mere listing of people and dishes.&nbsp; None of the 
correspondents present during lunch bothered to ask why the vegetables looked so 
clean and shining, or why everything looked like we are being served Mansaf when 
the taste of Mansaf was not there.&nbsp; For those who do not know, the 
Karadshehs go through a very tedious and long process of cleaning the vegetables 
before serving them.&nbsp; Most vegetables are washed several times, then 
pealed, then washed after pealing, after which they are kept in a container 
filled with water and a dry-cleaning agent for several hours before being 
served.&nbsp; I wouldn't have gathered all this information had it not been for 
the fact that I have noticed, unlike all the ZW Correspondents present, the&nbsp; 
ultra-shining look of the vegetables served, particularly the carrots and the 
cucumbers.&nbsp; The Mansaf issue took some more effort from me to find out.&nbsp; 
It wasn't until the next day when I had a chance to sit with Abla Z., who 
happened to sit with the Karadshehs that same morning.&nbsp; She told me that 
she couldn't help noticing Naief adding water to the Mansaf on several 
occasions.&nbsp; The poor Jameed must have given in at last.</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">This letter&nbsp; to you, Mr. Editor, is not intended to 
instigate you to make any decisions to fire or hire Correspondents, but, merely, 
as always, to share things with the rest of the Zureikats.</font></i></p>

The Zureikat Weekly during the past eleven weeks, which were, without a doubt, 
much different for our newsletter.&nbsp; I would also like to thank our 
Correspondents and Photographers (especially those who managed to send their 
news and photos regularly).&nbsp; Secondly, I would like to make the following 
announcements:</font></p>

this.</font></p>
