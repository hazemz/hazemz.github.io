<font face="Arial">On Saturday, November 23, 2002, in the afternoon, Zureikats 
were going to attend a church service for Issa Oweiss when Hassan felt dizzy.&nbsp; 
He was immediately taken to the Jordan Hospital spending a few hours at the ICU 
there.&nbsp; Hassan returned home Saturday night.&nbsp; Doctors said that 
Hassan's blood sugar level had dropped which caused the dizziness.&nbsp; The 
Zureikat Weekly would like to take this opportunity to wish Hassan a very speedy

<p align="center" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial" size="5">&quot;I'm undergoing the most intensive program I've ever 
been in&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial" size="4">&quot;Who would have thought that I'd be mastering the

<font face="Arial">In a phone call with the Editor in Chief last week, Dana gave 
the following statement to The Zureikat Weekly:</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">Dear family,</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">I'd like to tell everyone back home how much I miss them, 
and how much I think about every single person in the family and think, in this 
big city, how, at the end of the day, you need your family and that family is 
the most important thing in one's life.</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">Reading the ZW every week has been a delightful experience 
as tears roll down my face as I laugh really hard.&nbsp; I'd like to thank Mona, 
Alia, Reem, and Bana for their words of encouragement I received through the ZW.</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">I would also like to tell the family what a great 
experience this is.&nbsp; I'm undergoing the most intensive program I've ever 
been in in my life, but I also feel it's going to be the most rewarding 
experience of my life.&nbsp; I keep asking myself, &quot;Who would have thought that 
I'd be mastering the Arabic language in Washington DC?&quot;&nbsp; It's overwhelming.&nbsp; 
I'm undergoing training for two months on broadcasting, editing audio, reading 
and writing journalistically in Arabic, the art of reading for radio, which is 
quite different than television.&nbsp; The training program I'm undergoing  requires me to wake up at three o'clock in the morning.&nbsp; I shower, get ready 
(I think of Amal and miss her every time I brush my teeth!), and I leave the 
house at 4:30.&nbsp; It takes me half an hour to get to the office.&nbsp; I get 
there at five, early enough to read the newspaper, check my mail, and get myself 
some coffee.&nbsp; My training starts at six, and I get done at 4:00, 4:30, 
sometimes 5:00.</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">I'm already making a lot of good friends (nothing like 
family though!).</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<i><font face="Arial">Hugs and kisses to everyone...</font></i></p>

arrival of the new car, as he has been driving it 24/7, showing it off to all 
his friends.&nbsp; The ZW will provide a picture of the new car once Bashar 
returns home.&nbsp; As for the Lada, Omar has inherited the mess of metal.&nbsp; 
We all wish him good luck with that car and all the problems that come with it.</font></p>
