hasn't seen for nearly the past two hundred and fifty years.&nbsp; In her weekly 
e-mail to the Editor in Chief, Mona said, &quot;We are having still a great summer 
Sweden has not seen since 1756.&nbsp; People cannot believe it.&nbsp; We have a 
plumb tree which carried fruits since we planted it 17 years ago.&nbsp; Every 
year, when it should get ripe the night frost come and the sour taste never 
changed to sweet.&nbsp; This year we are enjoying its sugary taste for the first 
time.&quot;&nbsp; Regarding the Henning's latest news, Mona said, &quot;Dag is enjoying 
his work, and I had him with Helene for lunch we had a nice little grill party 
for the four of us.&nbsp; Sylvia is working from 7 o'clock in the morning and 
enjoying her patients.&nbsp; I will be with Gero in Germany next week over the 
weekend.&quot;</font></p>

expected to return soon.&nbsp; A couple of days before Chandra's return, Amer sent an e-mail to The Zureikat Weekly.&nbsp; 
In his e-mail, Amer said, &quot;Dear all.&nbsp; I ask you to join me in wishing 
Chandra and Jeena a very speedy return to Amman where they are - without a doubt 
- much needed and missed.&nbsp; I'm sure life is grinding to a halt without 
them.&nbsp; All is well in Dublin.&quot;</font></p>

Alia said, &quot; A week ago, we welcomed the arrival of a new family member, a 
Golden Retriever named Tipsy.&nbsp; We bought her from Mr. Bassam Mufleh.&nbsp; 
She's beautiful, very calm.&nbsp; Even Mom loves her!&nbsp; The two German 
Shepherds, Whisky and Rocks, have moved to Anjara.&nbsp; Mom describes Tipsy as 
the &quot;first decent dog we've had since Buster!&quot;&nbsp; I guess that's because - or 
so it seems - her grandmother is at HRH Prince Hassan's!!!&nbsp; Now, at last, 
Mom and Dad can stop fighting and Nick, the Hennings' dog, has finally got a 
cousin!!!!!&quot;</font></p>
