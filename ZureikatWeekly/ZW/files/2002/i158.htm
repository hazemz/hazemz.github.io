<font face="Arial">For the past few months, the question of what will happen to 
The Zureikat Weekly in the future has been asked by many.&nbsp; Today, and after 
many consultations with family members, the Editor in Chief of The Zureikat 
Weekly has decided not to suspend the family's newsletter.&nbsp; The decision 
came, as the Editor in Chief said, &quot;after considering the success our newsletter 
has made throughout the past three years&quot;.&nbsp; He said, &quot;It would be very sad, 
after considering all this success, to even think of closing The Zureikat 
Weekly.&quot;&nbsp; The Editor in Chief, who will be graduating on July 11 and 
studying at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota starting next fall, also 
said that the future Zureikat Weekly would need more support from the family.&nbsp; 
He said that he will be appointing correspondents for The Zureikat Weekly around 
the world to send him the latest news every week starting next September.</font></p>

refused to give any information regarding Bana's new job.&nbsp; She said, 
&quot;Children are individuals, and they should have their own privacy.&quot;&nbsp; She 
asked us to put this as The Zureikat Weekly's &quot;Motto of the Week&quot;.</font></p>
