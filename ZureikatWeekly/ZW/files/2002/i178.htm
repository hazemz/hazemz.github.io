was my first day on the job, and my father, who I now call (Abu Tarek), even at 
home, invited all the employees for lunch to welcome me.&nbsp; I even had to say 
a few words, and I talked about my first day in Dara Building, when Majdi was my 
boss, and how he made me clean about 4 dunums of empty just to make sure that I 
know I won't be getting any special treatment; they laughed.&nbsp; Anyway, I 
spend all my time attending meetings where people use vocabulary that I don't 
understand, and my challenge is to try and combine these words into a sentence 
that will hopefully make sense.&nbsp; Anyways, I am thoroughly enjoying it here; 
I feel I made the right decision leaving the UK.&nbsp; I also want to take this 
opportunity to congratulate Bashar on his promotion at Citibank, to Assistant 
Manager.&nbsp; He has really made us proud because he is the only one in the 
history of the bank to get promoted three times.&quot;</font></p>
