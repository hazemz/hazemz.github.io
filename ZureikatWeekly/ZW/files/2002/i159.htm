<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Tarek, who is currently working in 
England for the Nashville-based Southwestern Company, sent an e-mail to The 
Zureikat Weekly last week.&nbsp; In his e-mail, Tarek said, &quot;These next weeks 
before the selling season starts are going to be hectic.&nbsp; I have to meet 
everyone who is going to be selling in my group, which means, in the next 5 
days, I will be in Bradford, Leeds, Liverpool, London, maybe Southampton, and 
Belfast in Northern Ireland.&nbsp; I have someone working with me from Dublin, 
but I think I need a visa to go there... I'm looking forward to have a good 
selling season and leave my company on a good note so that I can go back to 
Jordan and start a business with my dad.&quot;&nbsp; In his e-mail, Tarek also 
congratulated Amer and Bana on their new jobs.&nbsp; &quot;I would like to take this 
opportunity to congratulate Amer and Bana for their new jobs and wish them the 
best of luck,&quot; he said.&nbsp; In reference to what we mentioned in last week's 
issue about Tarek calling himself &quot;the busiest Zureikat&quot;, Tarek said, &quot;I would 
also like to deny reports in your paper that I refer to myself as the busiest 
Zuriekat.&nbsp; I might be the most good looking, but I think it's unfair to 
call myself the busiest as I don't know how everyone else works.&quot;</font></p>
