<hr>
<p align="center" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 80pt; font-weight: 700">'End of an 
Era'</span></font></p>
<p align="center" dir="ltr">
<span style="font-weight: 700"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 54pt">The 
Zureikat Weekly signs-off</font></span></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 14pt">A brief timeline</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">The idea behind the Weekly came up in April 1999.&nbsp; Hazem 
was sending e-mails to members of the family who were studying or living abroad, 
updating them on the latest news concerning the family in Amman.&nbsp; After 
noticing that he had been sending the same e-mail to different people over and 
over again, Hazem decided to create a web site in which he could place all the 
family news periodically.&nbsp; The name 'Zureikat Weekly' was chosen for this 
web site, a logo was created, and the first issue was released on Friday, April 
23, 1999.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">With the addition of digital pictures to the Weekly in June 
1999, family members, especially those abroad, became more interested in the 
Weekly.&nbsp; Many started sending weekly e-mails, with their news, pictures, 
and suggestions on enriching the family newsletter.&nbsp; Since then, the 
quality of the ZW constantly improved.&nbsp; New sections were added and the 
number of readers increased.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">The fall of 2002 was a turning point for the ZW.&nbsp; The 
Editor in Chief was preparing to leave to the US to start his undergraduate 
study.&nbsp; There was concern over how the flow of family news would be 
organized.&nbsp; In August 2002, the Editor in Chief announced that the 
newsletter would continue to be released every week from the US.&nbsp; He 
appointed a team of correspondents and photographers to ensure the continued 
flow of news.&nbsp; The team was asked to send in their news every week by a 
specified deadline.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">Throughout the past six years, The Zureikat Weekly covered 
several major family events, the most important of which was the passing of the 
late Abu Harran in October 2004.&nbsp; Other events include the birth of Jad, 
two weddings, three engagements, and twelve graduations, among others.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">In March 2005, the Editor in Chief of the ZW decided to 
discontinue the newsletter after its 309th issue is released.&nbsp; 
The Editor cited changing times and priorities.&nbsp; He said that the family no 
longer needed a Zureikat Weekly, because the family has grown and the priorities 
of many have changed.&nbsp; The Editor's decision drew some criticism from 
several members of the family, but it also had some supporters.&nbsp; Despite 
the sometimes intense debates, the Editor in Chief decided to go on with his 
decision and discontinue the newsletter.&nbsp; This, the 309th issue, released on April 24, 2005, is the 
last issue of The Zureikat Weekly.</font></p>

<font face="Arial">I was very saddened by the news of the decision to terminate 
The Zureikat Weekly.&nbsp; As a correspondent, writing to The Zureikat Weekly 
was an integral part of my Sunday morning routine.&nbsp; It gave me the 
opportunity to take some time out of my schedule at work to reflect on the 
events of the preceding week. As the saying goes &quot;Life is what happens to you, 
when you're busy doing something else&quot;.&nbsp; Writing to The Zureikat Weekly 
allowed me to pause for a mere five minutes every week, to think of me and the 
rest of my family, and reflect on the events in our lives.</font></p>

<font face="Arial">Hard to sum up ones feelings about the 6-year story of the ZW 
in a short note.&nbsp; My initial reaction until last Tuesday was not to write 
anything except that two-line note that I had sent you earlier.&nbsp; Last 
Tuesday, Dana was visiting her aunt Amal at the clinic.&nbsp; Amal was being 
interviewed by a journalist for one of the local magazines.&nbsp; Dana, while 
listening, could not help but notice how Amal's face shone and glittered every 
time she had to talk about her family and where she was raised.&nbsp; Amal 
talked about her brothers and sisters with pride, Dana said.&nbsp; She talked 
about each and everyone (and I mean each and every one), listing their 
achievements that each had made in their life.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">Mona was on the phone with me the next day talking about our 
family, and we discussed for a while what we all can and must do to preserve the 
memory of our father and mother.&nbsp; We are a proud family and we all have a 
more than fifty year of a story to tell to our children and grandchildren.&nbsp; 
It is a legacy that will remain for generations.&nbsp; The ZW was the icing on 
the cream and much more.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">[Earlier note] It took one of the grandchildren of Abu Harran 
and Umm Harran to tell the story of this couple and the wonderful family that 
they have raised.&nbsp; The ZW is and will remain the most remarkable 
representation of the legacy that my father and mother left behind.&nbsp; They 
are not around to thank you for the six-year relentless effort, but I am sure 
that they, wherever they are, feel grateful and proud.&nbsp; Me too.</font></p>

<font face="Arial">Thank you, thank you, thank you for a lovely enriching six

<font face="Arial">I must say the highlight of my chilling Sundays was enjoying 
reading about the family news.&nbsp; I enjoyed the way you summarized the news 
as well, as some days I couldn't catch up with what was going on.&nbsp; That was 
highly appreciated, in addition to the family newsletter itself.&nbsp; I 
actually do support your decision for discontinuing the ZW.&nbsp; It will be 
missed, though!</font></p>

<p align="center" dir="ltr">
<img border="0" src="tarek.jpg" width="190" height="142"></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">It is difficult to put into words the amount of gratitude 
that I and, no doubt, the entire family have to Hazem for what he has done in 
the last 6 or 7 years (it's hard to keep count).&nbsp; I was always for the 
decision that the ZWeekly should stop now that Hazem is in university.&nbsp; 
Despite Hazem's statements to the contrary, I always felt it was unfair of us to 
put pressure on one person to deliver this product week in week out.&nbsp; 
And now that Hazem has finally decided to call it quits, we should not ask him 
to do otherwise.&nbsp; This has always been Hazem's invention.&nbsp; His 
enthusiasm and discipline ensured its continuation for as long as it has.&nbsp; 
If Hazem's<br>
conviction is altered for whatever reason, then the ZW continuation will simply 
be a burden on him.&nbsp; I salute Yacoub's brave decision to carry the torch.&nbsp; 
He is struggling to get help at the moment, which proves my earlier<br>
point.&nbsp; I wish him the best of luck and hope he succeeds.&nbsp; It will be 
exciting to see something different, and Yacoub should not shy away from making 
changes and adding his personal touch.</font></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">Nevertheless, if this is to be the final issue of the ZWeekly, 
I would like to point out a fact that the rest of the family seems to be 
missing. We should not be mourning the end of the ZWeekly.&nbsp; On the 
contrary, the family<br>
album is now complete.&nbsp; And like any other album, its real value is shown 
years after the album was put together.&nbsp; We now have a complete album for 
six or seven (I should have looked this up) years.&nbsp; A few years from now 
when Jad asks about Abu Harran and Umm Harran, just think about how much we will 
be able to share with him.</font></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">On a different subject, I want to remind the Auntihat that my 
parents are out of the country and I have not been getting the attention that I 
am used to getting in these circumstances.</font></p>

<b><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 32pt">Final Words from the Editor in 
Chief</font></b></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial" size="4">The first image I had in my mind of what this final 
issue would look like was that of a special issue with pictures from different 
family events covered by the ZW throughout the past six years.&nbsp; I also 
thought of not having any current news and dedicating the entire issue to look 
back at the past years.&nbsp; But, after some thought, I decided against that.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial" size="4">Yes, The Zureikat Weekly has endured for six long 
years.&nbsp; Yes, the newsletter has managed to document major family news on a 
weekly basis, which was important in preserving our family history.&nbsp; But--and I say it bluntly and honestly--The Zureikat Weekly and its discontinuation 
were quite overrated by many.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial" size="4">As Marwan put it in his latest e-mail, the ZW was 
&quot;the icing on the cream&quot;.&nbsp; We all realize the fact that we have a special 
family.&nbsp; We have realized this fact long before the Weekly was initiated in 
1999, and we will surely realize this fact long after the Weekly is discontinued 
in 2005.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial" size="4">The Zureikat Weekly should not be thought of as 
something that has brought the family together for the past six years.&nbsp; It is 
things that are beyond this newsletter, such as the way we were all raised, that 
have kept the spirit of Abu Harran and Umm Harran alive in each of us.&nbsp; The 
Weekly was merely a means to maintain a flow of information within the family.&nbsp; 
The decision to discontinue came only because this means of communication was, 
in my opinion, no longer applicable at this time.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial" size="4">Nevertheless, we celebrate today the end of an 
important era.&nbsp; Looking back at all those years, I find no better way to 
end this newsletter than to thank each and every person who contributed to the 
success of this project.&nbsp; By reading the ZW, taking pictures, sending your 
news and comments, and, of course, by making the news, you have all made working 
on this newsletter a great joy for me.&nbsp; It has been an honor serving as 
Editor in Chief.</font></p>

Harran's House</big></big></font></p>

Aqaba with some friends</big></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">A family Easter lunch was held at Harran's 
house on Easter (Sunday, April 11, 1999).&nbsp; All family members who were in Jordan 
at that time attended the lunch except Ayman, Talal, and Omar who spent their 
Easter vacation with some friends from Amman National School in Aqaba.&nbsp; The 
lunch at Harran's house included Koosa and Warak, chicken, Reema's usual chicken 
pie, and other kinds of food.&nbsp; There was also an egg hunt for the kids (Sabine, 
Nadine, Yacoub Zureikat, and Yacoub Shomali).</font></p>

to the Gulf Coast</font></big></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Hala told Hazem in an e-mail she wrote him on 
Monday, April 19, 1999 that she, Naief, Dalia, Dina, and Salem will be driving 
to Mobile on the Gulf Coast (south of Alabama) on Friday, April 23, 1999. &nbsp; 
Naief will be attending a conference and will spend, along with his family, the 
weekend there.&nbsp; On the other hand, Naief's sister and her husband visited Naief 
and Hala a few days ago in Birmingham, Alabama.</font></p>

Scholarship</font></big></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Last Thursday (April 15), Talal was 
interviewed to attend one of the seven United World Colleges next year to 
complete his IB diploma. The interview came after a series of exams that Talal 
had to sit for and he was chosen with 19 other students of his age from a huge 
group of 500 students to be eligible for the scholarship.&nbsp; The unofficial 
results of the interview state that Talal is a first runner-up for the 
scholarship, i.e. if any of the chosen students refuse to accept the 
scholarship, he will be granted it instead.&nbsp; What should be mentioned is that 
Bana was previously granted the same scholarship three years ago to attend the 
UWC of the Atlantic in Wales.&nbsp; She graduated last May and she says that the UWC 
experience was the best experience of her life.</font></p>
