Correspondent Slams Editor's Decision, Suggests Biweekly Alternative</font></p>

appreciate Yacoub's initiative of a 'new' weekly, I feel that the current one

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">Hi Hazem, </font></i></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">Following our phone conversation 
yesterday [Friday, April 8], I am writing to urge you to reconsider.&nbsp; As I 
said, several members of the family are shocked, including myself.&nbsp; I think 
that's because we have always felt that the newsletter is indispensable, while 
others may have taken it for granted, assuming that no matter what happens, it 
will always be there.</font></i></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">I have received several phone 
calls from a number of Zureikats, some of whom have urged me to persuade you to 
change your mind, saying that, although they have written to you protesting 
against your decision, it seems that you are adamant to terminate the Weekly.</font></i></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">I believe that, contrary to what 
you have previously mentioned, we still &quot;need&quot; the ZW.&nbsp; It is still a 
source binding us together, especially to those members abroad.</font></i></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">In light of the above, I am 
proposing that we change the journal from weekly to biweekly or tri-weekly, or 
even once a month.&nbsp; By doing this, we would continue documenting our 
important and historic events for future generations to come.&nbsp; Though we 
all appreciate Yacoub's initiative of a 'new' weekly, I feel that the current 
one should continue for another two to three years, during which time you can 
begin handing over the responsibility one step at a time to another team of 
'managers' as you see fit.</font></i></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Arial">As Editor in Chief, the decision 
is yours to make.&nbsp; I just felt like sharing my thoughts with you, in hope 
that you will, at the very least, postpone the discontinuation of a valuable 
six-year initiative that has brought us joy, pride and inspiration, reminding us 
time and time again of how lucky we all are to have such a wonderful family.</font></i></p>

Badran, 69, is a biologist by training and a pedagogue by profession.&nbsp; 
Before becoming president of Philadelphia University in 1998, he served as 
UNESCO deputy director general in Paris.&nbsp; He also held several prestigious 
posts at the University of Jordan before his appointment as president of Yarmouk 
University, a position that he held from 1976 to 1986.&nbsp; The government 
change was made amidst popular frustration with the former government's 
reluctance to pursue political reform and development and with its diplomatic 
gaffes that disturbed Jordan's inter-Arab relations.</font></b></p>
