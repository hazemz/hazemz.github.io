	say that Jordan had a role in a suicide bombing last month.&nbsp; Now Iraq 
	has pulled its envoy out of Amman for consultations, saying relations were 
	&quot;in crisis mode&quot;.&nbsp; Protests were held outside the Jordanian embassy in 
	Baghdad on Friday, and an Iraqi flag was raised over the building, while 
	Jordanian flags were burnt.&nbsp; Shia groups are angry after reports that 
	the family of a Jordanian, Raed Mansour al-Banna, held celebrations after he 
	carried out a suicide bombing which killed 125 people in Hillah, south of 
	Baghdad, on 28 February.&nbsp; Nearly all the victims of that attack were 
	Shia police and army recruits.&nbsp; The Jordanian flag was burnt during

	United States, and had intended to continue to directly to the summit.&nbsp;

	would normalize relations with Israel prior to a comprehensive 
	Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.&nbsp; Jordan accepted amendments to its
