	the scope of activities of the country's professional associations, the 
	government on Wednesday said it was including an article to a draft law that 
	would sever the unions' ties with their branches in the Palestinian 
	territories.&nbsp; The proposed law, which was approved last night by the 
	Cabinet, authorizes the Audit Bureau to inspect the associations' financial 
	records, according to Minister of Interior Samir Habashneh, who on Tuesday 
	presented an outline of the draft law to parliamentary blocs. The minister, 
	who yesterday met with independent deputies, said association funds should 
	be spent only in Jordan and on activities that upgrade professional 
	standards. He said the law was necessary to advance the professional mandate 
	of the associations, expand the scope of participation and achieve fair 
	distribution of association funds to all governorates. The draft also 
	permits these associations to open branches in the Kingdom's governorates.
