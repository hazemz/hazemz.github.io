Editor in Chief</font></b></p>
<p align="center" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 700">&quot;The family's 
failure to contribute...will result in the discontinuation of the newsletter in the very near future.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="3">Many of you might have 
noticed that the last few issues of The Zureikat Weekly were very short.&nbsp; 
In general, I would not expect every single week to be eventful.&nbsp; After 
all, we are only a family; how much news can we make in one week?&nbsp; But the 
problem is not the lack of news, it is, rather, the lack of cooperation from the 
ZW Correspondents.&nbsp; Many correspondents have not sent any e-mails in more 
than a month.&nbsp; Others who did not have any news sent e-mails saying 'no 
news to report for this week', which I very much appreciate.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">I would like to take this 
opportunity to urge all correspondents to send weekly e-mails to the ZW by the specified deadline.&nbsp; Even if there were no news for a certain week, a 
correspondent should send an e-mail.&nbsp; I would also like to ask other 
members of the family to send in their news, comments and suggestions.&nbsp; 
Since appointing the Correspondents three years ago, e-mails from other family 
members haven't been coming in as they used to.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Again, this is not about the lack 
of news.&nbsp; It is about the lack of correspondence.&nbsp; The ZW depends on 
your input now more than ever.&nbsp; The family's failure to contribute to the 
Weekly will result in the discontinuation of the newsletter in the very near future.</font></p>
