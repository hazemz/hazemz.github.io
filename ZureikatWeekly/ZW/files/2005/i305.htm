Editor in Chief</font></b></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Dear Zureikats,</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">After careful thought and 
consideration of current circumstances, I have decided to discontinue The 
Zureikat Weekly after four weeks.&nbsp; The 309th issue, which will be released 
on April 24, 2005, one day after the newsletter's 6th anniversary, will be the 
final issue.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Although many of you might disagree 
with this decision, I believe it is for the best.&nbsp; The newsletter has come 
a long way in the past six years, but the family has also grown and changed.&nbsp; 
Each of us now has his or her own priorities, and smaller Zureikat families now 
have their own &quot;kingdoms&quot;, to use Marwan's words.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Finally, it has been a pleasure 
producing this newsletter for the past six years.&nbsp; I thank all those who 
supported the ZW and wish you all, all the best.</font></p>

<p align="center" dir="ltr"><b><font face="Arial" size="5">A Longstanding 
Debate</font></b></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The debate over the future of The 
Zureikat Weekly has been present for a long time.&nbsp; It probably started 
before the Editor in Chief left to the US in 2002, but the height of it came in 
November 2003 when Marwan sent an open letter suggesting the discontinuation of 
the family newsletter.&nbsp; The suggestion drew harsh criticism from most of 
the family, after which the debate ended.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Following is the full text of 
Marwan's letter to the Editor in Chief, which was published in the 233rd issue 
(released on November 9, 2003):</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Courier New" size="2">Dear Hazem,</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Courier New" size="2">I have hesitated a lot before I 
decided to write this letter to you.&nbsp; I have been regularly reading The 
Zureikat Weekly issues and never stopped admiring the effort and the dedication 
that is needed to keep this web magazine running weekly, non-stop, for over 4.5 
years.&nbsp; However, I consider it the right time now to consider stopping the 
issue of the Weekly and/or consider other options to maintain flow of the family 
news and information.</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Courier New" size="2">It is no secret that the Weekly was 
intended to maintain and keep our family culture and values.&nbsp; It is not a 
coincidence that the Weekly was thought of and initiated by you after the 
passing away of your grandmother.&nbsp; It was one expression of your and our 
desire to keep her memory and what she stood for alive and living with us.&nbsp; 
But with the passing of time, things change.&nbsp; The family grows, and people 
age.&nbsp; The bonds that used to tie the family become overshadowed by other 
priorities and interests.&nbsp; It is a fact now that some of us have no 
relationship with the Weekly at all.&nbsp; Others do not read it, and many do 
not contribute to it.&nbsp; To keep forcing the Weekly would, in my mind, be 
like working against the tide and may result in negative consequences.&nbsp; It 
is great to maintain and keep our family values and culture, but this is 
something that we should not force and must leave for each of the smaller 
Zureikat family units to deal with in the manner they deem convenient to them.</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Courier New" size="2">The Zureikat Weekly has done a 
great job.&nbsp; Its significance and value are huge.&nbsp; In the future, we 
will all look back at it and be proud of it.&nbsp; It will serve as an example 
for those who will follow us.&nbsp; For me, it has shown, more than anything 
else, how much of a difference a single individual can make given the dedication 
and commitment that you have shown.&nbsp; I am certainly a proud father and a 
proud Zureikat.</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><i><font face="Courier New" size="2">I leave it to you to consider this 
issue and make whatever decision you deem appropriate.</font></i></p>
