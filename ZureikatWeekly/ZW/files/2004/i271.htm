	Washington, DC.&nbsp; We had been to the Marriott for a nice brunch.&nbsp; 
	Following that, we took a ride on the boat in the Potomac River.&nbsp; We 
	also ate ice cream at the Washington Harbor.&nbsp; We've also been to Six 
	Flags, which was the greatest place ever.&nbsp; I was the one who loved it 
	the most!&nbsp; We rode roller coasters and many other cool games!&nbsp; 
	We've [also] been to the Kennedy Center lately, [and] we attended a 
	classical music concert.&nbsp; So, as you see, whenever my mother has some 
	time, we just try to enjoy at the most our stay here.&nbsp; We started
