neighborhood in the capital in a new wave of violence Saturday that killed at 
least five people and wounded dozens of others.&nbsp;
US warplanes and tanks later bombarded targets in the volatile city of Fallujah, 
and US forces exchanged gunfire with insurgents along the city's eastern 
outskirts and the main highway running to neighboring Jordan, witnesses said. 
The fighting left at least 14 people injured, hospital officials said. The new 
fighting came as residents of Najaf began digging the holy city out of the 
rubble and debris left by three weeks of fierce fighting between militants and 
US forces. The crisis ended Friday when the militants withdrew under a peace 
deal brokered by Iraq's most senior Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani.
