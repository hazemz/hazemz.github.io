<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Basil's nephew, Hani Majdi Shomali, 
died on Thursday, August 12, 2004, in a bus accident in Syria.&nbsp; The 
20-year-old was on his way to visit relatives in the city of Hims when the bus 
he was on crashed killing more than twenty people.&nbsp; Mr. Majdi 
Shomali, his wife, and his sister Rose, as well as other Shomalis, arrived in Amman on Friday 
and Saturday, August 13 and 14.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Basil and Omar left to Hims 
early Friday morning to arrange transporting Hani's body.&nbsp; The body arrived 
in Amman on Saturday and was transported to Palestine early Sunday.&nbsp; 
What should be mentioned is that Hani was in Amman last month, where he attended 
Bashar and Rana's engagement party.&nbsp; The Zureikat Weekly and the Zureikat family would like to extend their deepest condolences to Basil, Mr. Majdi, and the Shomali family on the 
passing away of Hani.&nbsp; May God rest his soul.</font></p>
