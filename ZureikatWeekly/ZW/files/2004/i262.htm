8pm.&nbsp; Our official meetings take place from 10am to 6pm at the UN 
headquarters, where delegates deliberate 3 to 4 articles a day (there are 25 
draft articles in the current document).&nbsp; The rest is all informal meetings 
between the various delegations and the NGOs participating (e.g. Arab, Asian and 
Latin American caucuses).&nbsp; There are around 110 countries participating in 
this convention, along with 250 NGO representatives.&nbsp; Within those, 40% are 
people with various disabilities.</i></font></p>

us in New Orleans, to get his expertise on the subject.&nbsp; Hazem, Ayman and 
myself went to buy the laptop in the West Side of New Orleans, where we had to 
take a taxi and cross the river.&nbsp; Looking at so many laptops, each with its 
own specification, was confusing to me, but to Hazem was a straightforward 
problem, and out of these many, we picked the Toshiba model.</font></i></p>
