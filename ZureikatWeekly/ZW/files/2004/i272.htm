<font face="Arial">&quot;Alia Harran Zureikat - the Will and the Challenge&quot; was the 
title of a special aired on Jordan Television last Wednesday, August 4, 2004. 
During the special, which was part of a program dedicated to persons with 
disabilities, Alia spoke from her office at the National Council for Family 
Affairs about her childhood, her life at college, and about her work. Alia also 
described her experience at the conference she recently attended at the United 
Nations in New York. At the end of the special, Alia sent a message to the 
viewers and to society, saying that people with disabilities are, above all, 
human beings who can work and contribute to society just like anyone else.&nbsp; 
What should be mentioned is that a rerun of the program was aired on Saturday, 
August 7.</font></p><hr>

Shiite communities across Iraq.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Iraqi interim Prime Minister 
Iyad Allawi signed an amnesty Saturday that was intended to persuade Iraqis 
fighting a 15-month-old insurgency to put down their weapons and join in 
government efforts to rebuild the country.&nbsp; But the law, which pardoned 
only minor criminals, not those guilty of killings or terror attacks, appeared 
unlikely to dampen the violence, and some insurgent leaders immediately rejected 
the move as &quot;insignificant.&quot;&nbsp; Also Saturday, the government ordered the 
offices of the pan-Arab television station Al Jazeera closed for 30 days,
