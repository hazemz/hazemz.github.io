<i><font face="Arial">Bana Shomali - Amman, Jordan - April 21, 2004:</font></i></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preparations for the jaha started a 
week before the big day.&nbsp; 300 cheese rolls were rolled, 300 meat puffs were 
puffed, a wide variety of tossed salads were tossed, and an endless amount of 
warag dawali was twirled and tucked all by the relentless hands of Abla, Teta 
Umm Basil, Majdi, Astuti and Ayouni.&nbsp; The Arabic coffee stood brewing at 
the Shomali stove for five days, an intricate operation led by Majdi, whose 
special coffee is renowned among the families of Beit Sahour.&nbsp; The rest of 
us handled the logistics of that evening, through running an inventory of the 
plates, forks, knives and chairs, to make sure that both food and comfort were 
in abundance that night.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the evening of April 20, the jaha started pouring into our 
house at 7:00pm, where Basil, Abla and Bashar greeted the men with Majdi’s 
freshly brewed coffee.&nbsp; At 7:30pm, the fleet of cars led by Basil and 
Bashar left toward Rana’s grandfather’s house, Abu Mash-hour el-Dababneh.&nbsp; 
A small glitch occurred when we realized that we had forgotten Yacoub at home 
and had to send off one of Bashar’s friends back to retrieve him.&nbsp; Yacoub’s 
pride was hurt, but soon recovered toward the end of the night.&nbsp; At the 
Dababneh house, yet another surprise was waiting for us.&nbsp; Harran, caught by 
surprise, was asked to speak for the Shomalis by Basil’s uncle.&nbsp; Harran 
skillfully mastered the shock, and improvised a warm and heart-filled speech, 
and asked for Rana’s hand from the Dababnehs.&nbsp; The request was received 
with a quick approval, and was followed by trays and trays of straight whiskey 
shots for the jaha (a unique, but pleasantly intoxicating, Beit Sahouri 
tradition).&nbsp; Bashar and Rana later exchanged their wedding rings in a 
simple ceremony as a sign of commitment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shomalis and Zureikats later returned to our house for 
drinks and appetizers.&nbsp; Umm Basil initiated the celebration with a series 
of “haa haat” and “awweehat”, and traditional Sahouri singing, dancing and 
handkerchief waving.&nbsp; Reema also contributed with her zaghareet and her 
version of “haa haat” which she had conveniently scribbled on a small piece of 
paper just in case she forgot the lines.&nbsp; The duo of Umm Basil and Reema 
was soon interrupted when the loud echo of men reciting “Tlawlahi ya Dalieh” 
came flooding into the house.&nbsp; Bashar’s friends had greeted Bashar and Rana 
at the steps of the house, and threw a spontaneous mini-zaffeh for the couple on 
their way into the house.&nbsp; The rest of the invitees joined the zaffeh, and 
the echoes of singing and the tableh could be heard across the neighborhood.&nbsp; 
Abu Farid Shomali, Bashar’s godfather, also recited the original version of 
“Natt il Biss 3ala Dahir il Cheess”, a traditional Sahouri song written by Abu 
Farid’s grandfather.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night continued with lots of drinking, eating, and 
spontaneous bursts of “haa haat” here and there.&nbsp; All in all, it was a 
successful night, due to the efforts of everyone in the family, Shomalis and 
Zureikats, be it in the preparations, or in the moral and emotional support 
extended to the tense couple, Bashar and Rana, not to mention Bashar’s parents.&nbsp; 
One should also mention that the night was missing a few, but very important 
people, namely Jiddo, who had excused himself from attending the party, the 
Karadshehs, the Hennings, Hassan, Amer and Leanne, Dana and Ammar, Hazem, the 
Sharaihas (Ziad, Reem, Samer, Ayman and Talal), and last, but not least, Kareem 
Zureikat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shomalis would like to thank everyone for coming to the 
party and would like to extend their congratulations to Bashar and Rana.&nbsp; 
We welcome Rana to the family and to the Zureikat Weekly.&nbsp; We wish the new 
couple a future filled with success, happiness, and interesting editions of the 
ZW.</font></p>

this opportunity to congratulate Bashar and Rana on their jaha, wishing them all 
the happiness and success.</font></p>

<p align="center" dir="ltr"><img border="0" src="marwan.jpg" width="190" height="142"></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Marwan sent the following letter to 
the Editor in Chief:</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Dear Editor,</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Chandra has been away now for two 
weeks.&nbsp; It is quiet at home without Chandra, more so than in her past 
vacations, given that Tarek is &quot;independent&quot; and Hazem is away.&nbsp; Abla is 
attending to the housekeeping with little help from me.&nbsp; She does the 
laundry and very little (near to nothing) cooking.&nbsp; The folks at Houston's 
are not complaining anymore that they do not see me as often as they like.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Speaking of doing the laundry, it 
was late in the evening two weeks ago when we were both watching television.&nbsp; 
Abla suddenly sprung from her chair, approached me, and bent under my chair as 
if she was examining something.&nbsp; She then went back to where she was 
sitting, brought her glasses, and repeated the same act with me wondering what 
the hell she was doing.&nbsp; It was a few seconds before she declared that &quot;she 
thinks&quot; that I am wearing socks of two different colors, one black and one dark 
brown.&nbsp; I glanced at my socks and was quick to disagree with her.&nbsp; We 
argued for a few minutes before I decided to take my socks off for further 
examination.&nbsp; Lights in the living room were not bright enough to reach a 
conclusive decision, and we had to go to the kitchen (with the socks, of course) 
where it was bright enough to enable both of us to agree conclusively: YES, they 
were of different colors.</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">It would seem to you, Mr. Editor, 
and the rest of the ZW members that this is one typical and common story that 
happens often with many people.&nbsp; Actually, this was my first reaction until 
I concluded that since the socks that I am wearing are of two different colors, 
then it is only logical that there is another pair in my closet that Abla had 
folded that is composed of two different colors.&nbsp; For the past two weeks, I 
have been living the agony of having to check each pair every day.&nbsp; Do it 
myself first with the lights in the bedroom, check with Abla for further 
confirmation, and often having to go to the kitchen window for a conclusive 
decision.&nbsp; It was only until this morning that we celebrated the 
apprehension of that pair.</font></p>
