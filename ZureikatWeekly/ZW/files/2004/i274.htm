include collecting all documents and reports related to the case of liquidated 
Petra Bank, founded by Chalabi in 1977. The family of Chalabi, who was convicted 
in absentia in Jordan in 1992 on several counts of fraud, filed a suit in 
Washington last week against the government claiming that it conspired with
