<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The first snow storm in this winter 
season hit Jordan on Saturday and Sunday, February 14 and 15, 2004, causing 
schools, universities, and businesses to close on Sunday.&nbsp; No damages to 
Zureikat homes were reported to The Zureikat Weekly before releasing this issue.&nbsp; 
The effect of the cold front causing the snowfall weakened Sunday evening, and 
the Jordan Meteorological Department said that there was little chance of 
snowfall on Monday.&nbsp; In an e-mail she sent to the Editor in Chief, Reema 
said, &quot;Of course, both Harran and Alia are on top of the world.&nbsp; Cora has 
been squeaking with joy and amazement ever since she saw the snow!!&nbsp; She's 
been taking pictures the whole time.&quot;</font></p>

friends to the mall.&nbsp; After that, my family and I went to a dinner in our 
friends house!&nbsp; On Saturday, we went to the National Theater in DC to watch 
the play 'Mamma Mia'.&nbsp; It was a wonderful play.&nbsp; It was funny.&nbsp; 
They sang a lot of the Abba songs, and their dancing was modern.&nbsp; After 
that, mom, Deena, and I went to a restaurant in the Pentagon City Mall in 
Virginia.&nbsp; Then we looked for some clothes over there.&nbsp; We will have a 
holiday on Monday for President's Day.&quot;</font></p>
