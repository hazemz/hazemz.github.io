birthday on Wednesday, January 28, 2004.&nbsp; In an e-mail she sent to the 
Editor in Chief, Reema said, &quot;I am writing to tell how lovely this birthday 
was.&nbsp; Abla N. was kind to initiate and host a breakfast on the occasion in 
my favorite cafe, Blue Fig.&nbsp; She invited Abla Z. and Dian too, and we had a 
lovely chat and delicious manageesh and cheese pastries.&nbsp; It was different 
and everybody enjoyed it.&nbsp; I wished everybody was there.&nbsp; Funny 
enough, my classmates invited me for coffee to the same place in the afternoon!!&nbsp; 
Other members of the family either called or showed up.&nbsp; The subject of my 
age was not discussed!&quot;&nbsp; Also celebrating this occasion, Harran, Reema, 
Alia, and Reema's sister (Rita Ayoub) and her daughter had dinner at La Maison 
Verte restaurant.&nbsp; The Zureikat Weekly would like to take this opportunity 
to wish Reema a very happy birthday and all the best.</font></p>

Editor in Chief, Dalia updated us with the latest from Maryland.&nbsp; &quot;The 
weather is still bad,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;We have tons and tons of snow.&nbsp; We 
also have to walk very carefully so as not to fall down.&nbsp; The second 
semester started on January 28, and for all of us here our grades were fine, 
between A's and B's.&nbsp; As for me, the second semester is quite a change, 
again as if it is a new beginning for me.&nbsp; I have the same subjects, with 
different teachers and different students.&nbsp; Our French is getting better 
and better.&nbsp; Salem will be joining the science club at school which is part 
of the after-school activities.&nbsp; As for our social life, my parents got to 
know many French couples here, and we were invited last weekend to one of them.&nbsp; 
We had nice dinner with their kids.&nbsp; We have American friends now also.&nbsp; 
We invited some of them yesterday night [Saturday, January 31], and they 
appreciated my mother's cooking.&nbsp; My mother also started her classes.&nbsp; 
She managed to have all her activities in the morning so that she will be home 
in the afternoon with us.&nbsp; She is happy because we help her a lot in 
housework so that she can put more time for her fellowship.&quot;</font></b></p>
