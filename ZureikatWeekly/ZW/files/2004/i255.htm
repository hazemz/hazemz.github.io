<font face="Arial">Karadshehs returned to Maryland on Wednesday, April 7, 2004, 
after spending three days in New York City.&nbsp; The 
family had left to New York on Sunday, April 4.&nbsp; What should be mentioned 
is that Dalia, Deena, and Salem are currently on vacation.&nbsp; Their spring 
break started on Saturday, April 3, and will end on Monday, April 12.&nbsp; 
Following is Dalia's weekly e-mail to the Editor in Chief:</font></p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<font face="Arial">&quot;Last weekend (the one before we went to NY), we went to 
Washington to see the &quot;Cherry Blossoms&quot; festival, and also it was a beautiful 
day for flying kites.&nbsp; We bought kites for Deena and Salem.&nbsp; There 
were a lot of people near the Washington Monument.&nbsp; The Cherry Blossoms 
were so beautiful!&nbsp; Next Sunday, we drove to New York!&nbsp; On Monday, my 
mom went with her Humphrey fellows group to visit the Rockefeller Center and the 
NBC studios.&nbsp; They also visited the Committee to Protect Journalists and 
ate lunch there.&nbsp; While we went and ate lunch in a restaurant and met my 
mom there.&nbsp; Mom's friend also joined us.&nbsp; After lunch, we went to the 
Empire State Building.&nbsp; We got up to the highest floor (86th).&nbsp; Later 
in the afternoon, we had a nice walk till Broadway.&nbsp; On Tuesday, my mom 
went to the ABC newsroom (World News Tonight) and the New York Times, while we 
took the tour bus from the hotel early in the morning.&nbsp; We visited a lot of 
places!&nbsp; First, we went to Central Park, then the Rockefeller Center.&nbsp; 
We saw people ice skating there.&nbsp; In front of the Rockefeller Center was an 
old beautiful Catholic church.&nbsp; After the church, we went to Chinatown, and 
we saw the apartment building were they shot the comedy series &quot;Friends&quot;.&nbsp; 
We saw a courthouse and another park were they shot movies in too.&nbsp; After 
the break, we saw the Twin Towers Memorial.&nbsp; After that, we took the boat 
to Ellis Island (the entry point of all European immigrants).&nbsp; We stayed 
there for while, and then we went by boat to the Statue of Liberty.&nbsp; On 
Wednesday, my mom went to the United Nations.&nbsp; We joined her there, and 
visited the General Assembly.&nbsp; We sat in the place where the Jordanian 
delegation sits.&nbsp; We had lunch at the cafeteria of the UN.&nbsp; We walked 
on to Broadway again, and we saw the MTV building, where there were famous 
singers, and it was surrounded by a lot of people who wanted to meet them.&nbsp; 
And also in Times Square, there were some preparations for a shooting a film.&nbsp; 
We left New York at 7pm with the hope that my dad will take us again there 
because we just loved it!&nbsp; It is really a crazy city!&nbsp; We would like 
to wish Jiddo and all family members a very happy Easter.&nbsp; We miss them 
all.&quot;</font></p>
