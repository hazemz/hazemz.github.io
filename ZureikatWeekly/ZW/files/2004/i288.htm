		as a death sentence, and people avoid submitting to cancer tests for 
		fear of discovering that they have it... The public should know that 
		cancer is not a death sentence; that it can be cured,” said Senator Ziad 
		Sharaiha, president of the conference, who is also the president of the 
		Private physicians Association. </font></p>
		<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The aim of this gathering 
		is to raise public awareness, through lectures and interactive sessions, 
		where the public can ask questions about the disease, Sharaiha told 
		reporters. </font></p>
		<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">“It is important that 
		doctors are aware of the importance of early detection and prevention, 
		and how to spot tumors, because it is their responsibility to inform 
		their patients, that is why such a conference is important for both 
		doctors and patients,” Sharaiha explained. </font></p><hr>
