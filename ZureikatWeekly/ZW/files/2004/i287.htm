		nominated and selected to be a member of Tau Beta Pi, the largest honor 
		society for engineers in the US.&nbsp; An initiation ceremony was held 
		for the new members on Wednesday, November 17, 2004.&nbsp; Tau Beta Pi 
		is the America's second-oldest society, founded at Lehigh University in 
		1885 to recognize students of distinguished scholarship and exemplary 
		character.&nbsp; There are now collegiate chapters at 228 US colleges 
		and universities.&nbsp; The primary criterion for election is the 
		student's rank in the Engineering School; senior electees are among the 
		top 1/5 of their class.&nbsp; Being elected to membership in the 
		national engineering honor society is a great honor, not only because of 
		the high standards for scholarship and character, but also because these 
		outstanding qualities have been recognized in the student by other 
		fellow engineering students.&nbsp; The Zureikat Weekly would like to 
		take this opportunity to congratulate Ayman on this great honor, wishing 
		him all the best.</font></p><hr>
