		letter from Marwan Zureikat</font></b></p>

		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">Dear Webmaster,</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">The question as to what are the 
		limitations, if any, on the potentials of this electronic age was never 
		as striking in my mind as it was this morning, Sunday April 30. 2006. 
		Before I get into the reason why this has been the issue for me today, I 
		want to remind you that Abla and I are miles away from being considered 
		computer illiterates. We both do spend good times every day working 
		behind the computer screen. I may also remind you that we have a 
		facility to have access to the internet concurrently, thanks to a device 
		that Hazem had installed in our (SYSTEM) last year.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">This morning, Abla was preparing 
		to go to our farm house in Umm Al-Amad, when she declared that she was 
		going to take her laptop with her. When I laughingly pointed out that 
		this would not serve any purpose because we do not have an internet 
		connection there, she quickly dismissed the issue, saying that someone 
		in Umm Al-Amad must have a wireless connection and that she would sneak 
		through and use it. She reminded me that Hazem used to use the Reuters 
		network. Reuters, as you know, are our next door neighbors in Amman.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">Before I surrender to this, I 
		wanted to check with you. I have managed to convince Abla to hold on 
		this adventure until we hear from you. For those who do not know, Umm 
		Al-Amad is a near 10,000 sq. km area, occupied mainly by Bani Sakher, 
		who live in tent-like houses at an average of one house per sq. km.</font></p>
