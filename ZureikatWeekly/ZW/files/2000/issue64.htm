Sweden have finally responded to our calls.&nbsp; After not sending any news
updates for a long time, Mona sent the following update to the Editor in Chief:
&quot;Sylvia is in Heidelberg, Germany practicing in a university hospital, and Gero
and I will be visiting her next week.&nbsp; Helene is working for IBM in Milan and
has an interesting job.&nbsp; Dag is coming today (July 16) back from Greece.&nbsp;
He has been on a sailing trip with other friends.&nbsp; We have been living almost every day in rain.&nbsp;
The sun we saw only few times.&nbsp; Gero and I have done a wonderful trip in Gota
Canal, a boat trip in this channel which binds the different lakes in Sweden
together all the way from Stockholm to Gothenburg on the west cost.&nbsp; The trip took us 4 days.&nbsp;
Otherwise, I have been very busy with Dar Al-Mona's new books to be published soon.&quot;&nbsp;
Dag also sent his first e-mail to The Zureikat Weekly two days after returning
from his sailing trip in Greece mentioned above: &quot;I work since August, 1998 as key account and channel manager at a software company which is specialized in network security
solutions.&nbsp; Please <a href="http://www.effnet.com" target="_blank"> visit our
website</a>.&nbsp; There is a lot of traveling involved around Sweden and in Europe.&nbsp;
I live in a one-room apartment in the Stockholm center and I drive a black, two-seated sports car with red leather
seats, 0-100 km/h in just 6 seconds.&nbsp; I have no girlfriend (still working on it).&nbsp;
I just came home from a sailing trip down in Greece, and on Wednesday (July 19),
I will be going to Gotland.&nbsp; Gotland is the biggest island in the Baltic Sea.&nbsp;
There will be a lot of partying, swimming, and hanging out with some of my best Swedish
friends.&nbsp; Well, I guess that the Baltic Sea will not be as warm as the Red Sea.&nbsp;
I will probably get a cold.&nbsp; I will try to take a week off this fall to come down to visit you guys.&nbsp;
I know it has been a while, and I feel bad about it.&nbsp; Tell everybody I send my regards, and that I love you all.&quot;</font></p>
