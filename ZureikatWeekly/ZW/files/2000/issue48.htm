<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Dana, who is currently studying at
the American University in Cairo, won the Showtime Internship Award.&nbsp; The
formal announcement will be made in an awards dinner on June 12 in Cairo.&nbsp;
President of the Adham Center, Abdullah Schleifer will announce the two winners,
Dana and her friend Effat Kamel.&nbsp; The Zureikat Weekly has received the
following e-mail sent from Schleifer to MBC's Moataz Demerdash in London:</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="3">Dear Moataz:<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">
<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">
<o:p>It’s June 12th (the awards dinner).&nbsp; Please do come.&nbsp; Everyone would
be honored and delighted, and I will put you up on the podium with me and the
VIPs.&nbsp; Incidentally, we recently made Peter Einstein of Showtime an
Associate, and Peter was so proud of the appointment that Showtime pr people are
placing big stories with photographs of himself and the Provost shaking hands
and with Peter saying very nice things about the Center and announcing a
Showtime Summer Intern program for an outstanding Adham Center graduate –
three months in London, Showtime pays airfare, accommodation and modest salary.&nbsp;
Actually, when I formally announce the winners at the dinner, I will be able to
announce that Showtime has decided to increase the Internship awards to two
outstanding graduates.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="3">One of those two winners is
an exceptionally good&nbsp;producer-reporter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She is from Jordan, and she is a natural correspondent and shoots her own
superb pictures as well and, of course, can edit like all of our graduates.&nbsp;
I believe she would make a great MBC correspondent, after the Showtime
Internship ends.&nbsp; She is very attracted to the hard news,
confrontation-coverage of competitive international journalism – she could
become MBC's own Christiane Amanpour.&nbsp; She would love to have a shot at the
MBC Jerusalem correspondent slot,&nbsp;and, as an East Banker, I believe she
could be sufficiently detached to do a great job and get full cooperation from
the Israelis, as well as, obviously, from the Palestinians and the Jordanians.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">Her name is Dana Zureikat, and
I will be happy to introduce you to her at the dinner.&nbsp; If you want her
demonstration tape before then, let me know, and I will pass them on to the MBC
bureau to send on to you.<br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><br>
In case you get more than one trip to Cairo in the next two months, you might
also consider coming in on May 15th when we have the graduate projects
presentation. But if you get only one trip then please make it the Annual Awards
Dinner.<br>
<br>
Yours, Abdullah</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Zureikat Weekly would like
to congratulate Dana on winning this award and wish her all the best.</font></p>

expected to return home to Amman on a brief visit on Tuesday, April 4, 2000.</font></p>
