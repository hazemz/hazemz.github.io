<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>&quot;I just called to congratulate myself and my family on
achieving my medical doctorate degree.&nbsp; I would also, at this time, like to express my gratitude to my parents for the overwhelming support and invaluable advice that they have given me throughout my college
years.&nbsp; They have been a source of inspiration, and words cannot express how much
I am proud of them.&nbsp; My gratitude also goes out to all members of the
Zureikat family for their support over the past years, and a special thank you to the Editor in Chief for
making my graduation an exception in that this is a breaking issue story.&nbsp; I would like to invite everyone again to attend the ceremony
on the 26th of May, and I hope that everyone will be able to make it.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">In his phone call,
Amer also said that he got the job that he wanted, a 1-year internship program
in cardiology, endocrinology, general surgery, and brain surgery.&nbsp; On the
