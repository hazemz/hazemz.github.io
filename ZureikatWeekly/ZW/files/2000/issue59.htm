from the Kamal Adham Center for Television Journalism at the American University
in Cairo (AUC) with a Masters degree in TV journalism.&nbsp; The June 14
commencement ceremony was attended by Marwan, Abla N., Hazem, Reema, and Alia,
who visited Cairo this week <i>(More on this visit below)</i>.&nbsp; The Annual
Awards Dinner for the Adham Center was held on June 13, a night before the
commencement ceremony.&nbsp; In this dinner, Dana, along with her 9 classmates,
got two gifts from the center.&nbsp; The speaker in the awards dinner was
president of Al-Jazeera Satellite Channel, while the speaker in the June 14
commencement ceremony was the Egyptian Minister of Finance.&nbsp; Zureikats from
all around the world called Dana and visited her to congratulate her on this
great achievement.&nbsp; Mona sent an e-mail to The Zureikat Weekly to
congratulate Dana.&nbsp; &quot;We would like to extend our congratulations to
Dana on this fantastic achievement,&quot; she said.&nbsp; The Zureikat Weekly
would also like to congratulate Dana on her graduation and wish her all the best
and a bright and successful future.&nbsp; What should be mentioned is that Dana
and her classmate, Effat Kamel, got an internship award from Showtime.&nbsp;
This award includes three months of training in Showtime - London, airfare,
accommodation, and a monthly salary.&nbsp; Dana is expected to leave for London
in the beginning of July after she returns home some time this week (probably on
Wednesday, June 21, 2000).&nbsp; The names of the two winners of this award, Dana
and Effat, were also announced in the Annual Awards Dinner by Professor Abdallah
Schleifer.&nbsp; <b>Please note that cameras were not allowed in the June 14
commencement ceremony; the pictures of the commencement above were taken outside the hall.&nbsp;
However, AUC photographers have taken pictures of the ceremony, and we will be
showing them to you as soon as they arrive to Amman.<br>

Effat Kamel, who served this year as the AUC TV executive producer, and Dana

program as an ideal opportunity for moving from their Adham Center training into
their careers. &quot;Hopefully I will learn about various aspects of the

develop a thorough understanding of the nature of this business,&quot; Effat
said. &quot;I also hope that during my stay in London, I will be able to make
connections that might lead me down a great career path.&quot;</font>

educates and prepares its students to be qualified TV journalists but goes a
step further in guaranteeing them a secure career path by putting them in
