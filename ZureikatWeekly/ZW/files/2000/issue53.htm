her return home, Mona sent an e-mail to The Zureikat Weekly.&nbsp; In her
e-mail, Mona said, &quot;Life has been very intensive since I came back.&nbsp;
Preparing books for the printers, answering lots of mail and trying to adapt
again to the Swedish way of life.&nbsp; The big news is that the spring is here
now.&nbsp; It goes on very quickly seeing all the green leaves, flowers, and
birds.&nbsp; My garden is just like a paradise.&quot;&nbsp; In her e-mail, Mona
also said that Dag made a one-day business trip to Germany last week.&nbsp;
&quot;Today (Friday, May 5),&nbsp; I am going to meet Queen Sylvia in a reception
this afternoon,&quot; she continued, &quot;There is a big opening for an international
library in central Stockholm.&nbsp; Very few guest are invited, and Dar Al-Muna
is one of them.&nbsp; It will be interesting to be there.&nbsp; The whole month
of May will be a lot of work.&nbsp; It is the month of the year where every
thing has to be done before midsummer, from social activities to any thing else.&nbsp;
Gero and I are invited tomorrow to the Dutch embassy for dinner, and today in
the evening, I have some friends for a drink.&quot;</font></p>
