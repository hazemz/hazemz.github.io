<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Jordanian Minister
of Information, Taleb Rifa'i, held a press conference in Amman on Saturday,
December 23, 2000, announcing major changes in Jordan Television.&nbsp; The
changes include merging JTV's channels 1, 2, 3, and satellite channel into one,
super, 24-hour channel.&nbsp; These changes will take effect on January 1,
2001.&nbsp; Hala, Director of Channel 2, which will be closed, was appointed as
the new Director of International and Public Relations.&nbsp; Hala is a member
of the Strategic Planning Committee and the Local Productions Committee for the
new channel.&nbsp; In a phone call with The Zureikat Weekly, Hala said that she
was 100% for this decision and that it should have been taken by previous
administrations three or four years ago due to JTV's financial problems.&nbsp;
She also indicated that these changes are only temporary and may last for as
little as one year until &quot;we get back on our feet&quot;.</font></p>
