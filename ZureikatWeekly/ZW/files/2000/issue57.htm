<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>A Jordanian pioneer at the RCSI, Amer will leave a lasting legacy for future Jordanians to aspire to.&nbsp;
From day one, Amer engineered his way among the elite in his class.&nbsp; In his pre-medical year, Amer realized that his mental ability was so superior that one late night, tutorial with a needy student was sufficient to insure a smooth run through that
student's years at the RCSI.&nbsp; His contribution to RCSI was not just purely academic, however, he joined soccer training and took part proving his
sportsmanlike nature.&nbsp; In the fastest win ever at the intervarsity squash championships in Belfast (unfortunately it wasn't his).&nbsp;
Well-known to his friends for his obsession with toes and tattoos, he was frequently seen visiting Dublin's
prestigious night clubs.&nbsp; This gave him a premature knowledge of clinical signs and symptoms and sparked a new born interest in doctor-patient relationships as he was frequently practicing this with total strangers.<br>
    In his clinical years, his Jordanian ties were strengthened when he became a true ambassador for his country by frequently entertaining Jordanian visitors for long periods of stay.&nbsp;
With his Toyota Corolla and his good looks and charm in hand, he was often seen cruising around the Irish capital at odd hours of the day and night.&nbsp;
It has to be mentioned that Amer, during these last three years, tried soccer again and thought, but only thought, about regaining his tennis game.<br>
    On a final note, we are sure that this protective, proud, and idealistic Jordanian will lead wherever he lands.&nbsp;
He has made his mark par excellence and will surely be remembered for his sparkling personality, nicotine consumption, and his love for
Guinness.<br>
<b>In ten years time, we see Amer:</b> as a cardiology consultant back home in Jordan advising his patients to stop smoking with a pack of
Marlboro's in his white coat.</i></font></p>
