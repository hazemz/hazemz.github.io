phone and her warm hug when I used to come home.&nbsp; Amman to me will never be the same!&nbsp;
My tears are still fresh and her loss still hurts as if it is yesterday.&nbsp; She gave lots of things, one of them is determination.&nbsp;
She was very ambitious and her ambition is in every one of us.&nbsp; I will always
honor you UMM HARRAN!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">On July 30, 1997, Umm Harran passed
away.&nbsp; In 1998, one year after her death, the family built a gazebo in
a church in Ajloun in memory of Umm Harran.&nbsp; Now, two years after her sad
death, the family will be gathering in this church in Ajloun to remember the
late Umm Harran.&nbsp; The family will then go to Jerash to have lunch
there.&nbsp; More details and pictures in the 16th issue.</font></p>
