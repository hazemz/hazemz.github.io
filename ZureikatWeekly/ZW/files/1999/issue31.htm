<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">In her first e-mail to The Zureikat
Weekly in a long time, Reem said, &quot;I know its been a long time since I
wrote, but I've been working for the past ten weeks in a hospital in the middle
of nowhere!!&nbsp; I really am enjoying medicine; it's quite interesting meeting
new patients with new problems everyday.&quot;&nbsp; In her e-mail, Reem also
said, &quot;I've choreographed some dances for a play that was on two weeks
ago.&nbsp; We also held auditions for a fashion show that a friend and I are
organizing in February, where all the money we raise goes to charity (hopefully
if all goes well we are hoping to raise around £4000).&nbsp; Yesterday, we also
held auditions for a musical, (a friend and I are choreographing that as
well).&nbsp; I've also been elected to represent my year (3rd year rep), which
basically means that I am the connection between my year and the rest of the
consultants, sorting out their problems, etc.&quot;&nbsp; Regarding her father's
latest visit to London on his way back from Italy, Reem said, &quot;my dad came
to meet me for the evening on the 18th.&nbsp; It was a lovely dinner, and it was
really nice to catch up on&nbsp; family news.&quot;</font></p>
