<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial">&quot;She always told me it was her sense of
humour which kept her going&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Almost one week after her
grandmother's death, Helene sent an e-mail to The Zureikat Weekly.&nbsp; In her
e-mail, Helene said, &quot;I would like to take this opportunity of telling you a little about my grandmother who newly
faded into history.&nbsp; Her name was Wally Henning, but we all called her Oma,
which means "granny" in German.&nbsp; She has had a long and at times hard life (she has survived two
world wars).&nbsp;
She always told me it was her sense of humor which kept her going and I really believe her!&nbsp;
I have this poem I have written some time ago.&nbsp; I would like to dedicate it
to this proud and kind lady, who I had the honor of calling "Oma".&nbsp; The poem is
called "Do you remember":<br>
<br>
Do you remember the days before that day?<br>
I remember that I was crying,<br>
because you were leaving me you were going away,<br>
I felt that you were dying.<br>
<br>
Do you remember the very moment before,<br>
before you left for the other side?<br>
You looked at me with eyes that I could not ignore,<br>
You told me some words, then you died.<br>
<br>
Suddenly I did not feel the pain anymore,<br>
I was liberated, I felt free,<br>
It was as if the pain had been opened by a door,<br>
to which your words were the key.<br>
<br>
Today, you are watching me from above,<br>
your eyes are filled with fragile tears,<br>
I am filled with childish love,<br>
Your words are ringing in my ears:<br>
Do you remember? Do you remember?&quot;</font></p>

held for Gero's mother, the late Wally Henning, on Sunday, July 4, in Germany.&nbsp;
