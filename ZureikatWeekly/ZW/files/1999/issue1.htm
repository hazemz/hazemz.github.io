<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Last Thursday (April 15), Talal was interviewed to
attend one of the seven United World Colleges next year to complete his IB diploma. The
interview came after a series of exams that Talal had to sit for and he was chosen with 19
other students of his age from a huge group of 500 students to be eligible for the
scholarship.&nbsp; The unofficial results of the interview state that Talal is a first
runner-up for the scholarship, i.e. if any of the chosen students refuse to accept the
scholarship, he will be granted it instead.&nbsp; What should be mentioned is that Bana
was previously granted the same scholarship three years ago to attend the UWC of the
Atlantic in Wales.&nbsp; She graduated last May and she says that the UWC experience was
the best experience of her life.</font></p>
