<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Following is the message that the
Editor in Chief of The Zureikat Weekly wrote in the 27th issue:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>&quot;As you can see, this
issue of The Zureikat Weekly is almost blank.&nbsp; The Editor in Chief wishes
to voice an objection against the lack of cooperation from all the Zureikats who
failed to provide The Zureikat Weekly with any news.&nbsp; The Zureikat Weekly
is your magazine and can only continue with your support and cooperation.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">After his objection, the Editor in
Chief received only one response from Helene.&nbsp; In her e-mail, Helene said,
&quot;I always find it very amusing to read your web paper.&nbsp; I understand
that it can be very difficult to get our family to come up with news every week
(I myself have not written very often to you.&nbsp; I am sorry about
that).&nbsp; What about printing the newspaper every second week instead?&nbsp;
During two weeks time, everyone will have more news to tell.&nbsp; Now and then,
you can always print a special edition if there are urgent news.&quot;&nbsp; In
her e-mail, Helene also included her latest news.&nbsp; These news are included
in this issue.&nbsp; After Helene's suggestion, the Editor in Chief is expected
to send the readers of The Zureikat Weekly a questionnaire soon.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">After winning the elections for
president of the Arab Society in Edinburgh, Scotland last May, Tarek spoke in
the first dinner for the Arab Society.&nbsp; In his e-mail to The Zureikat
Weekly, Tarek said, &quot;I had a big day yesterday.&nbsp; It was the Arabic
Society's first event.&nbsp; It was just a dinner, but it took a whole day of
running around and advertising it to have enough people to come.&nbsp; I even
went to a few lectures and made announcements.&quot;</font></p>
