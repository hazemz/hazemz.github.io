&quot;I apologize for not providing you with any information for the
magazine.&nbsp; You have every right to be angry.&nbsp; I promise you I'll do my
part from now on.&nbsp; I think what you are doing is great for the family, and
I hope that last message you sent will wake everybody up.&quot;&nbsp; Tarek also
sent his latest news in his e-mail.&nbsp; &quot;I'm spending my next weekend in
Bristol for an awards banquet,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;It won't be ours as we
are having our own awards banquet in Edinburgh the week after.&nbsp; However, in
Bristol, there is a big &quot;Black Tie Ball&quot; (i.e. must wear a tuxedo) after
the awards ceremony.&nbsp; Please send my love to the Zuriekats all around, and
thanks for doing an amazing job with the magazine.&quot;</font></p>
