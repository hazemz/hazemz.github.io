celebrated Christmas last week.&nbsp; The family gathered at Harran's house on
Christmas Eve.&nbsp; Santa Claus attended the family gathering, as well as a few
guests, including Dian's sister, Jumana, Mr. Talal Al-Hassan, his wife, his daughter, Dr. Shabeeb
Ammari, and Basma Ammari, daughter of the late Nabil Ammari.&nbsp; Family
members, young and old, sang Christmas carols celebrating this joyous occasion.&nbsp;
During the Christmas Eve gathering, Amal read a letter, in front of all the
family, which was sent on August 31, 1939 by Farah Al-Jiryes, Umm Harran's
mother, to Abu Harran before he knew Umm Harran.</font></p>

the 21st century technically start on January 1, 2001, the whole world,
including the Zureikat family, are celebrating them this New Year's Eve.&nbsp; A

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="5">on the New Millennium</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4">The Zureikat Weekly may be
released every Sunday starting February</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">As the new millennium approaches,
The Zureikat Weekly is planning some new changes.&nbsp; There will be a new logo
for the magazine and a whole new look for its website.&nbsp; Another major
change may be taking effect in February.&nbsp; The Editor in Chief is expected
to send an e-mail to the Zureikats, after students return to their universities
abroad asking them if they prefer The Zureikat Weekly to be released on Sundays
instead of Fridays.&nbsp; If they agree, the 40th issue of The Zureikat Weekly
would be released on Sunday, February 6, 2000.&nbsp; This decision comes after
noticing that most of the magazine's readers visited the site of The Zureikat
Weekly on Mondays after their weekends, and after the Jordanian government
decided to switch the weekend in Jordan from Thursday and Friday to Friday and
Saturday.</font></p>
