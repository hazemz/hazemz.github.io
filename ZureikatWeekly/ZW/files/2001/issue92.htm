<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" size="4">A letter that Marwan received
from Tarek's group director at the Southwestern Company, Dave Causer:</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Dear Mr. Zureikat,</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Although we've never had a chance to
meet, I just wanted to take a few minutes today to let you know about a special
recognition your son, Tarek has received at the Southwestern Company.&nbsp; As
you may be aware, we have approximately 3,000 students who work with us each
year.&nbsp; These are the most talented university students we can find from all
around the world.&nbsp; They are selected from a group of over 30,000 students
that are exposed to the Southwestern program each year.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Each year, five of these students
are nominated for Southwestern's Student Excellence Award.&nbsp; It's the award
given to the most outstanding students in each Director Group.&nbsp; This year,
Tarek has been nominated from our part of the company to represent us for this
prestigious award.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">At this time, I'm not sure whether
Tarek will win the final Student Excellence Award or not, but just that he has
been nominated as one of the final five out of the 3,000 students should let you
know how much we think of the outstanding job your son has done in the
Southwestern program.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">I personally had a chance to see
this in person last summer as I visited the Virginia area that Tarek was working
in.&nbsp; He personally sacrificed his own sales and income to help manage and
make sure the students he brought out for the summer were successful.&nbsp;
There wasn't any manager in the Southwestern Company who did more to help their
students be successful than Tarek did last year.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Proof of this was the great success
that Tarek's team had.&nbsp; Although they were below average at the start of
the summer, by the end they were a team who was competing for the top
recognition spots at Southwestern.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Tarek has developed excellent
communication skills and sales ability over the previous summers here at
Southwestern.&nbsp; He has become an exceptional leader and has a great future.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">I want to thank you personally for
raising such a fine outstanding young individual as Tarek.&nbsp; He is a rare
individual who will become a great leader in the future.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Although Jordan is a long way from
here, hopefully some day I will have a chance to visit.&nbsp; At that time, I
hope to be able to thank you in person for sending such an outstanding young man
to participate in our program.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">If there is anything I could ever do
to assist Tarek, I hope you would feel free to call or write.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Sincerely, Dave Causer, Director of
Sales&nbsp;</font></p>
