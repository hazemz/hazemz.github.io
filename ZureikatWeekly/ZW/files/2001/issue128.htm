<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Ayman and Talal sent their first 
e-mails to The Zureikat Weekly from university.&nbsp; In his e-mail, Ayman, who 
is now studying at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said, &quot;Well I think I 
settled in the States.&nbsp; It's cool around here, although it's gonna get 
freezing around here soon.&nbsp; Everything is fine, in terms of school, 
studying, and all other stuff...ishtagna lal manasef min idain Anti Abla N.&nbsp; 
Food is not that good here.&quot;&nbsp; Talal, who is now studying at St. George's 
Medical School in London, said in his e-mail, &quot;I just settled down in the 
university.&nbsp; Well I have actually settled in quite quickly and commenced my 
university life as a medic.&nbsp; The first two weeks were sort of introductory, 
just to get to know each other and all that, and then the real hard work starts.&nbsp; 
Yet I am enjoying myself as much as possible and balancing it with my studies.&nbsp; 
The weather is as shitty as usual, always raining and all that.&nbsp; My sister 
is doing fine, she actually helped me a lot at the beginning.&quot;&nbsp; In his 
e-mail, Talal also sent a message to Marwan, &quot;I joined the snooker club here, so 
when I come back, we will beat him again in billiardo.&quot;</font></p>
